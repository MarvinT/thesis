  abstract      = {We explored physiological changes correlated with song tutoring by recording the responses of caudal nidopallium neurons of zebra finches aged P21-P24 (days post hatching) to a broad spectrum of natural and synthetic stimuli. Those birds raised with their fathers tended to show behavioral evidence of song memorization but not of singing; thus auditory responses were not confounded by the birds' own vocalizations. In study 1, 37 of 158 neurons (23\%) in 17 of 22 tutored and untutored birds were selective for only 1 of 10 stimuli comprising broadband signals, early juvenile songs and calls, female calls, and adult songs. Approximately 30\% of the selective neurons (12/37 neurons in 9 birds) were selective for adult conspecific songs. All these were found in the song system nuclei HVC and paraHVC. Of 122 neurons (17 birds) in tutored birds, all of the conspecific song-selective neurons (8 neurons in 6 birds) were selective for the adult tutor song; none was selective for unfamiliar song. In study 2 with a different sampling strategy, we found that 11 of 12 song-selective neurons in 6 of 7 birds preferred the tutor song; none preferred unfamiliar or familiar conspecific songs. Most of these neurons were found in caudal lateral nidopallium (NCL) below HVC. Thus by the time a bird begins to sing, there are small numbers of tutor song-selective neurons distributed in several forebrain regions. We hypothesize that a small population of higher-order auditory neurons is innately selective for complex features of behaviorally relevant stimuli and these responses are modified by specific perceptual/social experience during development.},

We develop procedures to quantify and properly normalize the classical joint peristimulus time scatter diagram. These allow separation of the ``raw'' correlation into components caused by direct stimulus modulations of the single-neuron firing rates and those caused by various types of interaction between the two neurons. 3. A newly developed significance test (``surprise'') is applied to evaluate such inferences. 4. Application of the new procedures to simulated spike trains allowed the recovery of the known circuitry. In particular, it proved possible to recover fast stimulus-locked modulations of ``effective connectivity,'' even if they were masked by strong direct stimulus modulations of individual firing rates. These procedures thus present a clearly superior alternative to the commonly used ``shift predictor.'' 5. Adopting a model-based approach, we generalize the classical measures for quantifying a direct interneuronal connection (``efficacy'' and ``contribution'') to include possible stimulus-locked time variations. 6. Application of the new procedures to real spike trains from several different preparations showed that fast stimulus-locked modulations of ``effective connectivity'' also occur for real neurons.},

  abstract      = {The firing of inferior temporal cortex neurons is tuned to objects and faces, and in a complex scene, their receptive fields are reduced to become similar to the size of an object being fixated. These two properties may underlie how objects in scenes are encoded. An alternative hypothesis suggests that visual perception requires the binding of features of the visual target through spike synchrony in a neuronal assembly. To examine possible contributions of firing synchrony of inferior temporal neurons, we made simultaneous recordings of the activity of several neurons while macaques performed a visual discrimination task. The stimuli were presented in either plain or complex backgrounds. The encoding of information of neurons was analyzed using a decoding algorithm. Ninety-four percent to 99\% of the total information was available in the firing rate spike counts, and the contribution of spike timing calculated as stimulus-dependent synchronization (SDS) added only 1-6\% of information to the total that was independent of the spike counts in the complex background. Similar results were obtained in the plain background. The quantitatively small contribution of spike timing to the overall information available in spike patterns suggests that information encoding about which stimulus was shown by inferior temporal neurons is achieved mainly by rate coding. Furthermore, it was shown that there was little redundancy (6\%) between the information provided by the spike counts of the simultaneously recorded neurons, making spike counts an efficient population code with a high encoding capacity.},

Therefore, in the present study of neuronal plasticity in behaving monkeys, the net effect of a single neuron on another neuron (the ``functional connection'') was evaluated by cross-correlating the times of firing of the two neurons. When two neurons were induced to fire together within a short time window, the functional connection between them was potentiated, and when simultaneous firing was prevented, the connection was depressed. These modifications were strongly dependent on the behavioral context of the stimuli that induced them. The results indicate that changes in the temporal contingency between neurons are often necessary, but not sufficient, for cortical plasticity in the adult monkey: behavioral relevance is required.},

Recent findings suggest that a single type of impairment in the dynamics of perception, which affects the efficiency of short-term memory, might underlie the broad range of difficulties of dyslexics. Experimental findings show that the general population quickly and automatically tunes around incoming stimuli, 'anchors to them' and performs faster and more accurately when these stimuli are subsequently repeated. Dyslexic individuals fail to benefit from stimulus-specific repetitions. This deficit can account for phonological, working memory, visual and auditory difficulties, in addition to the greater sensitivity of dyslexics to external noise.},

Recent studies indicate that D-LDs perform poorly in many psychoacoustic tasks compared with individuals with normal reading ability. We found that D-LDs perform as well as normal readers in speech perception in noise and in a difficult tone comparison task. However, their performance did not improve when these same tasks were performed with a smaller stimulus set. In contrast to normal readers, they did not benefit from stimulus-specific repetitions, suggesting that they have difficulties forming perceptual anchors. These findings are inconsistent with previously suggested static models of dyslexia. Instead, we propose that D-LDs' core deficit is a general difficulty in dynamically constructing stimulus-specific predictions, deriving from deficient stimulus-specific adaptation mechanisms. This hypothesis provides a direct link between D-LDs' high-level difficulties and mechanisms at the level of specific neuronal circuits.},

  abstract      = {How can we concentrate on relevant sounds in noisy environments? A ``gain model'' suggests that auditory attention simply amplifies relevant and suppresses irrelevant afferent inputs. However, it is unclear whether this suffices when attended and ignored features overlap to stimulate the same neuronal receptive fields. A ``tuning model'' suggests that, in addition to gain, attention modulates feature selectivity of auditory neurons. We recorded magnetoencephalography, EEG, and functional MRI (fMRI) while subjects attended to tones delivered to one ear and ignored opposite-ear inputs. The attended ear was switched every 30 s to quantify how quickly the effects evolve. To produce overlapping inputs, the tones were presented alone vs. during white-noise masking notch-filtered +/-1/6 octaves around the tone center frequencies. Amplitude modulation (39 vs. 41 Hz in opposite ears) was applied for ``frequency tagging'' of attention effects on maskers. Noise masking reduced early (50-150 ms; N1) auditory responses to unattended tones. In support of the tuning model, selective attention canceled out this attenuating effect but did not modulate the gain of 50-150 ms activity to nonmasked tones or steady-state responses to the maskers themselves. These tuning effects originated at nonprimary auditory cortices, purportedly occupied by neurons that, without attention, have wider frequency tuning than +/-1/6 octaves. The attentional tuning evolved rapidly, during the first few seconds after attention switching, and correlated with behavioral discrimination performance. In conclusion, a simple gain model alone cannot explain auditory selective attention. In nonprimary auditory cortices, attention-driven short-term plasticity retunes neurons to segregate relevant sounds from noise.},

However, we know neither the source of gating signals nor the anatomical connections that could link the modulatory centers of the brain with the song system. Two of the song-control nuclei in the forebrain, the HVC (used as the proper name) and the interfacial nucleus of the nidopallium, both show auditory gating, and they receive input from the uvaeform nucleus (Uva) in the thalamus. We used a combination of anterograde and retrograde tracing methods to show that the dorsal part of the reticular formation and the medial habenula (MHb) project to the Uva. We also show by choline acetyl transferase immunohistochemistry that the MHb is cholinergic and sends cholinergic fibers to the Uva. Our findings suggest that the Uva might serve as a hub to coordinate neuromodulatory input into the song system.},

  abstract      = {The ability to maintain a conversation with one person while at a noisy cocktail party has often been used to illustrate a general characteristic of auditory selective attention, namely that perceivers' attention is usually directed to a particular set of sounds and not to others. Part of the cocktail party problem involves parsing co-occurring speech sounds and simultaneously integrating these various speech tokens into meaningful units (``auditory scene analysis''). Here, we review auditory perception and selective attention studies in an attempt to determine the role of perceptual organization in selective attention. Results from several behavioral and electrophysiological studies indicate that the ability to focus attention selectively on a particular sound source depends on a preliminary analysis that partitions the auditory input into distinct perceptual objects. Most findings can be accounted for by an object-based hypothesis in which auditory attention is allocated to perceptual objects derived from the auditory scene according to perceptual grouping principles.},

  abstract      = {Muscimol is a GABA A-agonist that causes rapid and reversible suppression of neurophysiological activity. Interpretations of the effects of muscimol infusions into the brain have been limited because of uncertainty about spread of the drug around the injection site. To solve this problem, the present study explored the use of a fluorophore-conjugated muscimol molecule (FCM). Whole-cell recordings from horizontal brain slices demonstrated that bath-applied FCM acts like muscimol in reversibly suppressing excitatory synaptic transmission. Two types of in vivo experiments demonstrated that the behavioral effects of FCM infusion are similar to the behavioral effects of muscimol infusion. FCM infusion into the rat amygdala before fear conditioning impaired both cued and contextual freezing, which were tested 24 or 48 h later. Normal fear conditioning occurred when these same rats were subsequently given phosphate-buffered saline infusions. FCM infusion into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex impaired accuracy during a delayed-response task. Histological analysis showed that the region of fluorescence was restricted to 0.5-1mm from the injection site. Myelinated fiber tracts acted as diffusional barriers, thereby shaping the overall spread of fluorescence. The results suggest that FCM is indeed useful for exploring the function of small brain regions.},

  abstract      = {Previous research has shown that postnatal exposure to simple, synthetic sounds can affect the sound representation in the auditory cortex as reflected by changes in the tonotopic map or other relatively simple tuning properties, such as AM tuning. However, their functional implications for neural processing in the generation of ethologically-based perception remain unexplored. Here we examined the effects of noise-rearing and social isolation on the neural processing of communication sounds such as species-specific song, in the primary auditory cortex analog of adult zebra finches. Our electrophysiological recordings reveal that neural tuning to simple frequency-based synthetic sounds is initially established in all the laminae independent of patterned acoustic experience; however, we provide the first evidence that early exposure to patterned sound statistics, such as those found in native sounds, is required for the subsequent emergence of neural selectivity for complex vocalizations and for shaping neural spiking precision in superficial and deep cortical laminae, and for creating efficient neural representations of song and a less redundant ensemble code in all the laminae. Our study also provides the first causal evidence for 'sparse coding', such that when the statistics of the stimuli were changed during rearing, as in noise-rearing, that the sparse or optimal representation for species-specific vocalizations disappeared. Taken together, these results imply that a layer-specific differential development of the auditory cortex requires patterned acoustic input, and a specialized and robust sensory representation of complex communication sounds in the auditory cortex requires a rich acoustic and social environment.},

To investigate the role of the auditory system in generating the selective responses observed in the song system, we recorded auditory responses in the zebra finch primary auditory forebrain, field L, and in a secondary auditory area, the caudal mesopallium. Field L and caudal mesopallium project directly or indirectly to the high vocal center and nucleus interface of the nidopallium and are presumed to provide substantial auditory input to the song system. We found that, on average, neurons in field L and caudal mesopallium did not show positive selective responses for the bird's own song or tutor song relative to conspecific song. Moreover, there were no particular sub-areas in the auditory telencephalon that were relatively more selective than the average. The selectivity for the bird's own song would therefore be restricted to song nuclei and would arise in one processing step, potentially found at the interface between the auditory and the song systems.},

  abstract      = {Rats can make extremely fine texture discriminations by ``whisking'' their vibrissa across the surface of an object. We have investigated one hypothesis for the neuronal basis of texture representation by measuring how clusters of neurons in the barrel cortex of anesthetized rats encode the kinetic features of sinusoidal whisker vibrations. Mutual information analyses of spike counts led to a number of findings. Information about vibration kinetics became available as early as 6 msec after stimulus onset and reached a peak at approximately 20-30 msec. Vibration speed, proportional to the product of vibration amplitude (A) and frequency (f), was the kinetic property most reliably reported by cortical neurons. Indeed, by measuring information when the complete stimulus set was collapsed into feature-defined groups, we found that neurons reduced the dimensionality of the stimulus from two features (A, f) to a single feature, the product Af. Moreover, because different neurons encode stimuli in the same manner, information loss was negligible even when the activity of separate neuronal clusters was pooled. This suggests a decoding scheme whereby target neurons could capture all available information simply by summating the signals from separate barrel cortex neurons. These results indicate that neuronal population activity provides sufficient information to allow nearly perfect discrimination of two vibrations, based on their deflection speeds, within a time scale comparable with that of a single whisking motion across a surface.},

We found that the activity of individual PF neurons represented both the cues and the associated responses, perhaps providing a neural substrate for their association. Furthermore, during learning, neural activity conveyed the direction of the animals' impending responses progressively earlier within each successive trial. The final level of activity just before the response, however, was unaffected by learning. These results suggest a role for the PF cortex in learning arbitrary cue-response associations, an ability critical for complex behavior.},

  abstract      = {Humans and animals are able to detect signals in noisy environments. Detection improves when the noise and the signal have different interaural phase relationships. The resulting improvement in detection threshold is called the binaural masking level difference. We investigated neural mechanisms underlying the release from masking in the inferior colliculus of barn owls in low-frequency and high-frequency neurons. A tone (signal) was presented either with the same interaural time difference as the noise (masker) or at a 180 degrees phase shift as compared with the interaural time difference of the noise. The changes in firing rates induced by the addition of a signal of increasing level while masker level was kept constant was well predicted by the relative responses to the masker and signal alone. In many cases, the response at the highest signal levels was dominated by the response to the signal alone, in spite of a significant response to the masker at low signal levels, suggesting the presence of occlusion. Detection thresholds and binaural masking level differences were widely distributed. The amount of release from masking increased with increasing masker level. Narrowly tuned neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus had detection thresholds that were lower than or similar to those of broadly tuned neurons in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus. Broadly tuned neurons exhibited higher masking level differences than narrowband neurons. These data suggest that detection has different spectral requirements from localization.},

For example, humans have approximately 30,000 cochlear neurons, but at least 1000 times as many neurons in the auditory cortex. Such apparently redundant internal representations have sometimes been proposed as necessary to overcome neuronal noise. We instead posit that they directly subserve computations of interest. Here we provide an example of how sparse overcomplete linear representations can directly solve difficult acoustic signal processing problems, using as an example monaural source separation using solely the cues provided by the differential filtering imposed on a source by its path from its origin to the cochlea [the head-related transfer function (HRTF)]. In contrast to much previous work, the HRTF is used here to separate auditory streams rather than to localize them in space. The experimentally testable predictions that arise from this model, including a novel method for estimating the optimal stimulus of a neuron using data from a multineuron recording experiment, are generic and apply to a wide range of sensory computations.},

  abstract      = {Acoustic processing requires integration over time. We have used in vivo intracellular recording to measure neuronal integration times in anesthetized rats. Using natural sounds and other stimuli, we found that synaptic inputs to auditory cortical neurons showed a rather long context dependence, up to > or =4 s (tau approximately 1 s), even though sound-evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances per se rarely lasted greater, similar 100 ms. Thalamic neurons showed only a much faster form of adaptation with a decay constant tau <100 ms, indicating that the long-lasting form originated from presynaptic mechanisms in the cortex, such as synaptic depression. Restricting knowledge of the stimulus history to only a few hundred milliseconds reduced the predictable response component to about half that of the optimal infinite-history model. Our results demonstrate the importance of long-range temporal effects in auditory cortex and suggest a potential neural substrate for auditory processing that requires integration over timescales of seconds or longer, such as stream segregation.},

  abstract      = {Spatially selective attention allows for the preferential processing of relevant stimuli when more information than can be processed in detail is presented simultaneously at distinct locations. Temporally selective attention may serve a similar function during speech perception by allowing listeners to allocate attentional resources to time windows that contain highly relevant acoustic information. To test this hypothesis, event-related potentials were compared in response to attention probes presented in six conditions during a narrative: concurrently with word onsets, beginning 50 and 100 ms before and after word onsets, and at random control intervals. Times for probe presentation were selected such that the acoustic environments of the narrative were matched for all conditions. Linguistic attention probes presented at and immediately following word onsets elicited larger amplitude N1s than control probes over medial and anterior regions. These results indicate that native speakers selectively process sounds presented at specific times during normal speech perception.},

Both before and after recognition training, participants listened to a continuous stream of six nonsense words arranged in pairs, such that the second word in each pair was completely predictable. After training, first words in pairs elicited a larger negativity beginning around 100 ms after onset. This effect was not evident for the completely predictable second words in pairs.

  abstract      = {Recent event-related potential (ERP) evidence demonstrates that adults employ temporally selective attention to preferentially process the initial portions of words in continuous speech. Doing so is an effective listening strategy since word-initial segments are highly informative. Although the development of this process remains unexplored, directing attention to word onsets may be important for speech processing in young children who would otherwise be overwhelmed by the rapidly changing acoustic signals that constitute speech. We examined the use of temporally selective attention in 3- to 5-year-old children listening to stories by comparing ERPs elicited by attention probes presented at four acoustically matched times relative to word onsets: concurrently with a word onset, 100 ms before, 100 ms after, and at random control times. By 80 ms, probes presented at and after word onsets elicited a larger negativity than probes presented before word onsets or at control times. The latency and distribution of this effect is similar to temporally and spatially selective attention effects measured in adults and, despite differences in polarity, spatially selective attention effects measured in children. These results indicate that, like adults, preschool aged children modulate temporally selective attention to preferentially process the initial portions of words in continuous speech.},

Receptive fields are thought to provide a representation of sensory experience from which the cerebral cortex may make interpretations. While it is essential to determine a neuron's receptive field, it remains unclear which features of the acoustic environment are specifically represented by neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI). We characterized cat AI spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) by finding both the spike-triggered average (STA) and stimulus dimensions that maximized the mutual information between response and stimulus. We derived a nonlinearity relating spiking to stimulus projection onto two maximally informative dimensions (MIDs). The STA was highly correlated with the first MID. Generally, the nonlinearity for the first MID was asymmetric and often monotonic in shape, while the second MID nonlinearity was symmetric and nonmonotonic. The joint nonlinearity for both MIDs revealed that most first and second MIDs were synergistic and thus should be considered conjointly. The difference between the nonlinearities suggests different possible roles for the MIDs in auditory processing.},

This study explored the neural correlates of this perceptual ability by measuring rapid changes of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in primary auditory cortex during detection of a target tone embedded in noise. Compared with responses in the passive state, STRF gain decreased during task performance in most cells. By contrast, STRF shape changes were excitatory and specific, and were strongest in cells with best frequencies near the target tone. The net effect of these adaptations was to accentuate the representation of the target tone relative to the noise by enhancing responses of near-target cells to the tone during high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tasks while suppressing responses of far-from-target cells to the masking noise in low-SNR tasks. These adaptive STRF changes were largest in high-performance sessions, confirming a close correlation with behavior.},

During the past decade, with the advent of multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing. This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding in general.},

Several recent studies have found that the amount of information coded by correlated activity about sensory and motor variables is small, casting doubt on the hypothesis that correlations between pairs of neurons are important for information coding. However, other studies have documented the appearance of coherent oscillations, during particular task epochs and conditions that require selective processing of sensory information, supporting the hypothesis that coherent oscillations between neurons might reflect the dynamic flow of information in the brain.},

We found that for a pair of neurons, the effect of noise correlations on information decoding can be zero when the effect of noise correlations on the information encoded obtains its largest positive or negative values. Furthermore, there can be no effect of noise correlations on the information encoded when it has an effect on information decoding. We also measured the effect of noise correlations on information encoding and decoding in simultaneously recorded neurons in the supplementary motor area to see how well d prime accounted for the information actually present in the neural responses and to see how noise correlations affected encoding and decoding in real data. These analyses showed that d prime provides an accurate measure of information encoding and decoding in our population of neurons. We also found that the effect of noise correlations on information encoding was somewhat larger than the effect of noise correlations on information decoding, but both were relatively small. Finally, as predicted theoretically, the effects of correlations were slightly greater for larger ensembles (3-8 neurons) than for pairs of neurons.},

Previously, we reported the strength of interneuronal correlation of spike count on the time scale of the behavioral epoch (2 sec) and noted its potential impact on signal pooling (Zohary et al., 1994). We have now examined correlation at longer and shorter time scales and found that pair-wise cross-correlation was predominantly short term (10-100 msec). Narrow, central peaks in the spike train cross-correlograms were largely responsible for correlated spike counts on the time scale of the behavioral epoch. Longer-term (many seconds to minutes) changes in the responsiveness of single neurons were observed in auto-correlations; however, these slow changes in time were on average uncorrelated between neurons. Knowledge of the limited time scale of correlation allowed the derivation of a more efficient metric for spike count correlation based on spike timing information, and it also revealed a potential relative advantage of larger neuronal pools for shorter integration times. Finally, correlation did not depend on the presence of the visual stimulus or the behavioral choice of the animal. It varied little with stimulus condition but was stronger between neurons with similar direction tuning curves. Taken together, our results strengthen the view that common input, common stimulus selectivity, and common noise are tightly linked in functioning cortical circuits.},

After training the monkeys, we used single-cell recording to compare neuronal responses to learned and unlearned batons. Responses to learned batons, though not enhanced in strength, were enhanced in selectivity for both individual parts and for whole batons. Whole-baton selectivity arose from a form of conjunctive encoding whereby two parts together exerted a greater influence on neuronal activity than predicted by the additive influence of each part considered individually.

  abstract      = {To determine if classical conditioning produces general or specific modification of responses to acoustic conditioned stimuli (CS), frequency receptive fields (RF) of neurons in guinea pig auditory cortex were determined before and up to 24 h after fear conditioning. Highly specific RF plasticity characterized by maximal increased responses to the CS frequency and decreased responses to the pretraining best frequency (BF) and other frequencies was observed in 70\% of conditioning cases. These opposing changes were often sufficient to produce a shift in tuning such that the frequency of the CS became the new BF. CS frequency specific plasticity was maintained as long as 24 h. Sensitization training produced general increased responses across the RF without CS specificity. The findings indicate that associative processes produce systematic modification of the auditory system's processing of frequency information and exemplify the advantages of combining receptive field analysis with behavioral training in the study of the neural bases of learning and memory.},

  abstract      = {Auditory cortical receptive field plasticity produced during behavioral learning may be considered to constitute ``physiological memory'' because it has major characteristics of behavioral memory: associativity, specificity, rapid acquisition, and long-term retention. To investigate basal forebrain mechanisms in receptive field plasticity, we paired a tone with stimulation of the nucleus basalis, the main subcortical source of cortical acetylcholine, in the adult guinea pig. Nucleus basalis stimulation produced electroencephalogram desynchronization that was blocked by systemic and cortical atropine. Paired tone/nucleus basalis stimulation, but not unpaired stimulation, induced receptive field plasticity similar to that produced by behavioral learning. Thus paired activation of the nucleus basalis is sufficient to induce receptive field plasticity, possibly via cholinergic actions in the cortex.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Due to its high polymorphism and importance for disease resistance, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been an important focus of many vertebrate genome projects. Avian MHC organization is of particular interest because the chicken Gallus gallus, the avian species with the best characterized MHC, possesses a highly streamlined minimal essential MHC, which is linked to resistance against specific pathogens. It remains unclear the extent to which this organization describes the situation in other birds and whether it represents a derived or ancestral condition. The sequencing of the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata genome, in combination with targeted bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequencing, has allowed us to characterize an MHC from a highly divergent and diverse avian lineage, the passerines. RESULTS: The zebra finch MHC exhibits a complex structure and history involving gene duplication and fragmentation. The zebra finch MHC includes multiple Class I and Class II genes, some of which appear to be pseudogenes, and spans a much more extensive genomic region than the chicken MHC, as evidenced by the presence of MHC genes on each of seven BACs spanning 739 kb. Cytogenetic (FISH) evidence and the genome assembly itself place core MHC genes on as many as four chromosomes with TAP and Class I genes mapping to different chromosomes. MHC Class II regions are further characterized by high endogenous retroviral content. Lastly, we find strong evidence of selection acting on sites within passerine MHC Class I and Class II genes. CONCLUSION: The zebra finch MHC differs markedly from that of the chicken, the only other bird species with a complete genome sequence. The apparent lack of synteny between TAP and the expressed MHC Class I locus is in fact reminiscent of a pattern seen in some mammalian lineages and may represent convergent evolution. Our analyses of the zebra finch MHC suggest a complex history involving chromosomal fission, gene duplication and translocation in the history of the MHC in birds, and highlight striking differences in MHC structure and organization among avian lineages.},

  abstract      = {In order to clarify the neuroanatomical basis for postulated muscarinic cholinergic control of a wide array of physiological processes in birds, the distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the brain of three avian species was investigated by quantitative autoradiography. The species consisted of two passerines (songbirds), the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and the song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and one galliform, the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). [3H]N-methyl scopolamine (NMS), a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist was used as the ligand to label the receptors. Initial experiments demonstrated that the binding of this ligand in the three species is saturable in the nanomolar range and has a high affinity (Kd = +/- 0.6 nM). Displacement experiments revealed that three muscarinic ligands competed in an order of potency characteristic of the mammalian muscarinic receptor (i.e., atropine greater than oxotremorine greater than carbachol) for NMS binding in the avian brain. In all three species, portions of the basal ganglia, such as the parolfactory lobe and the paleostriatum augmentatum, exhibited the highest density of binding. On the other hand, the paleostriatum primitivum, the avian homologue of the mammalian globus pallidus, contained very few binding sites. Other telencephalic sites, such as the ventral and dorsal hyperstriatum, also revealed relatively high receptor density. However, the neostriatum and especially the ectostriatum showed much lower levels. In the hypothalamus, in all three species, specific binding could be observed in the ventromedial nucleus and adjacent areas. The paraventricular nucleus also showed moderate levels of binding density, especially in the two songbird taxa. At a more rostral level, the preoptic area showed low levels of binding. In the quail, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area was clearly outlined in the autoradiograms by the low level of binding sites compared to the surrounding areas. In the two passerine species, nuclei of the song system were identified by either high or low levels of NMS binding. High binding defined area X and the mesencephalic nucleus, intercollicularis (ICo). In contrast, the robust nucleus of the archistriatum and the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum showed low levels of binding in comparison with the surrounding tissue. None of these nuclei were visible in the quail autoradiograms except for ICo, which appeared as in the passerines as a heavily labelled area surrounding the lightly labelled nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis. In all three species, the hippocampal complex was devoid of NMS binding except for two lateral dark bands that were present along the entire rostral to caudal extent of the hippocampus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract      = {Representations of sensory stimuli in the cerebral cortex can undergo progressive remodelling according to the behavioural importance of the stimuli. The cortex receives widespread projections from dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which are activated by new stimuli or unpredicted rewards, and are believed to provide a reinforcement signal for such learning-related cortical reorganization. In the primary auditory cortex (AI) dopamine release has been observed during auditory learning that remodels the sound-frequency representations. Furthermore, dopamine modulates long-term potentiation, a putative cellular mechanism underlying plasticity. Here we show that stimulating the VTA together with an auditory stimulus of a particular tone increases the cortical area and selectivity of the neural responses to that sound stimulus in AI. Conversely, the AI representations of nearby sound frequencies are selectively decreased. Strong, sharply tuned responses to the paired tones also emerge in a second cortical area, whereas the same stimuli evoke only poor or non-selective responses in this second cortical field in naive animals. In addition, we found that strong long-range coherence of neuronal discharge emerges between AI and this secondary auditory cortical area.},

To investigate the cortical mechanisms underlying such temporal plasticity, we trained rats in a 'sound maze' in which navigation using only auditory cues led to a target location paired with food reward. In this task, the repetition rate of noise pulses increased as the distance between the rat and target location decreased. After training in the sound maze, neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) showed greater responses to high-rate noise pulses and stronger phase-locking of responses to the stimuli; they also showed shorter post-stimulation suppression and stronger rebound activation. These improved temporal dynamics transferred to trains of pure-tone pips. Control animals that received identical sound stimulation but were given free access to food showed the same results as naive rats. We conclude that this auditory perceptual learning results in improvements in temporal processing, which may be mediated by enhanced cortical response dynamics.},

  abstract      = {Animal vocalizations in natural settings are invariably accompanied by an acoustic background with a complex statistical structure. We have previously demonstrated that neuronal responses in primary auditory cortex of halothane-anesthetized cats depend strongly on the natural background. Here, we study in detail the neuronal responses to the background sounds and their relationships to the responses to the foreground sounds. Natural bird chirps as well as modifications of these chirps were used. The chirps were decomposed into three components: the clean chirps, their echoes, and the background noise. The last two were weaker than the clean chirp by 13 and 29 dB on average respectively. The test stimuli consisted of the full natural stimulus, the three basic components, and their three pairwise combinations. When the level of the background components (echoes and background noise) presented alone was sufficiently loud to evoke neuronal activity, these background components had an unexpectedly strong effect on the responses of the neurons to the main bird chirp. In particular, the responses to the original chirps were more similar on average to the responses evoked by the two background components than to the responses evoked by the clean chirp, both in terms of the evoked spike count and in terms of the temporal pattern of the responses. These results suggest that some of the neurons responded specifically to the acoustic background even when presented together with the substantially louder main chirp, and may imply that neurons in A1 already participate in auditory source segregation.},

This developmental sequence suggests that brain areas that encode auditory memories communicate with brain areas for learned vocal control. In the songbird, the secondary auditory telencephalic region caudal mesopallium (CM) contains neurons that encode aspects of auditory experience. We investigated whether CM is an important source of auditory input to two sensorimotor structures implicated in singing, the telencephalic song nucleus interface (NIf) and HVC. We used reversible inactivation methods to show that activity in CM is necessary for much of the auditory-evoked activity that can be detected in NIf and HVC of anesthetized adult male zebra finches. Furthermore, extracellular and intracellular recordings along with spike-triggered averaging methods indicate that auditory selectivity for the bird's own song is enhanced between CM and NIf. We used lentiviral-mediated tracing methods to confirm that CM neurons directly innervate NIf. To our surprise, these tracing studies also revealed a direct projection from CM to HVC. We combined irreversible lesions of NIf with reversible inactivation of CM to establish that CM supplies a direct source of auditory drive to HVC. Finally, using chronic recording methods, we found that CM neurons are active in response to song playback and during singing, indicating their potential importance to song perception and processing of auditory feedback. These results establish the functional synaptic linkage between sites of auditory and vocal learning and may identify an important substrate for learned vocal communication.},

These experiments reveal that many synapses in hippocampus and neocortex are bidirectionally modifiable, that the modifications persist long enough to contribute to long-term memory storage, and that key variables governing the sign of synaptic plasticity are the amount of NMDA receptor activation and the recent history of cortical activity.},

Detection was positively correlated with the magnitude of the change in the envelope frequency. Surprisingly, neuronal responses recorded in the primary auditory cortex of trained monkeys were globally suppressed by the modulated tone. However, the contrast in neuronal responsiveness to small increases versus large increases in envelope frequencies was actually enhanced in the trained animals. The results suggest behaviorally contingent inhibitory and excitatory processes that are modulated by the probability that a particular signal predicts a reward.},

  abstract      = {Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect subthreshold integrative processes that complement spike train measures. However, little is yet known about the differences between how LFPs and spikes encode rich naturalistic sensory stimuli. We addressed this question by recording LFPs and spikes from the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques while presenting a color movie. We then determined how the power of LFPs and spikes at different frequencies represents the visual features in the movie. We found that the most informative LFP frequency ranges were 1-8 and 60-100 Hz. LFPs in the range of 12-40 Hz carried little information about the stimulus, and may primarily reflect neuromodulatory inputs. Spike power was informative only at frequencies <12 Hz. We further quantified ``signal correlations'' (correlations in the trial-averaged power response to different stimuli) and ``noise correlations'' (trial-by-trial correlations in the fluctuations around the average) of LFPs and spikes recorded from the same electrode. We found positive signal correlation between high-gamma LFPs (60-100 Hz) and spikes, as well as strong positive signal correlation within high-gamma LFPs, suggesting that high-gamma LFPs and spikes are generated within the same network. LFPs <24 Hz shared strong positive noise correlations, indicating that they are influenced by a common source, such as a diffuse neuromodulatory input. LFPs <40 Hz showed very little signal and noise correlations with LFPs >40 Hz and with spikes, suggesting that low-frequency LFPs reflect neural processes that in natural conditions are fully decoupled from those giving rise to spikes and to high-gamma LFPs.},

  abstract      = {Studies analyzing sensory cortical processing or trying to decode brain activity often rely on a combination of different electrophysiological signals, such as local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity. Understanding the relation between these signals and sensory stimuli and between different components of these signals is hence of great interest. We here provide an analysis of LFPs and spiking activity recorded from visual and auditory cortex during stimulation with natural stimuli. In particular, we focus on the time scales on which different components of these signals are informative about the stimulus, and on the dependencies between different components of these signals. Addressing the first question, we find that stimulus information in low frequency bands (<12 Hz) is high, regardless of whether their energy is computed at the scale of milliseconds or seconds. Stimulus information in higher bands (>50 Hz), in contrast, is scale dependent, and is larger when the energy is averaged over several hundreds of milliseconds. Indeed, combined analysis of signal reliability and information revealed that the energy of slow LFP fluctuations is well related to the stimulus even when considering individual or few cycles, while the energy of fast LFP oscillations carries information only when averaged over many cycles. Addressing the second question, we find that stimulus information in different LFP bands, and in different LFP bands and spiking activity, is largely independent regardless of time scale or sensory system. Taken together, these findings suggest that different LFP bands represent dynamic natural stimuli on distinct time scales and together provide a potentially rich source of information for sensory processing or decoding brain activity.},

  abstract      = {The phenomenon of binaural interference, where binaural judgments of a high-frequency target stimulus are disrupted by the presence of a simultaneous low-frequency interferer, can largely be explained using principles of auditory grouping and segregation. Evidence for this relationship comes from a number of previous studies showing that the manipulation of simultaneous grouping cues such as harmonicity and onset synchrony can influence the strength of the phenomenon. In this study, it is shown that sequential grouping cues can also influence whether binaural interference occurs. Subjects indicated the lateral position of a high-frequency sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) tone containing an interaural time difference. Perceived lateral positions were reduced by the presence of a simultaneous diotic low-frequency SAM tone, but were largely restored when the interferer was ``captured'' in a stream of identical tones. A control condition confirmed that the effect was not due to peripheral adaptation. The data lend further support to the idea that binaural interference is affected by processes related to the perceptual organization of auditory information. Modifications to existing grouping-based models are proposed that may help account for binaural interference effects more successfully.},

  abstract      = {If spatial attention acts like a ``spotlight,'' focusing on one location and excluding others, it may be advantageous to have all targets of interest within the same spatial region. This hypothesis was explored using a task where listeners reported keywords from two simultaneous talkers. In Experiment 1, the two talkers were placed symmetrically about the frontal midline with various angular separations. While there was a small performance improvement for moderate separations, the improvement decreased for larger separations. However, the dependency of the relative talker intensities on spatial configuration accounted for these effects. Experiment 2 tested whether spatial separation improved the intelligibility of each source, an effect that could counteract any degradation in performance as sources fell outside the spatial spotlight of attention. In this experiment, intelligibility of individual sources was equalized across configurations by adding masking noise. Under these conditions, the cost of divided listening (the drop in performance when reporting both messages compared to reporting just one) was smaller when the spatial separation was small. These results suggest that spatial separation enhances the intelligibility of individual sources in a competing pair but increases the cost associated with having to process both sources simultaneously, consistent with the attentional spotlight hypothesis.},

  abstract      = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of hearing impairment on a listener's ability to process simultaneous spoken messages. DESIGN: Nine young listeners with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and nine young listeners with normal hearing participated in this study. Two messages of equal level were presented separately to the two ears. The messages were systematically degraded by adding speech-shaped noise. Listeners performed a single task in which report of one message was required and a dual task in which report of both messages was required. RESULTS: As the level of the added noise was increased, performance on both single and dual tasks declined. In the dual task, performance on the message reported second was poorer and more sensitive to the noise level than performance on the message reported first. When compared to listeners with normal hearing, listeners with hearing loss showed a larger deficit in recall of the second message than the first. This difference disappeared when performance of the hearing loss group was compared to that of the normal-hearing group at a poorer signal to noise ratio. CONCLUSIONS: A listener's ability to process a secondary message is more sensitive to noise and hearing impairment than the ability to process a primary message. Tasks involving the processing of simultaneous messages may be useful for assessing hearing handicap and the benefits of rehabilitation in realistic listening scenarios.},

This effect has been studied extensively for speech intelligibility in the presence of interfering sounds. In the current study, listeners identified zebra finch song, which shares many acoustic properties with speech but lacks semantic and linguistic content. Three maskers with the same long-term spectral content but different short-term statistics were used: (1) chorus (combinations of unfamiliar zebra finch songs), (2) song-shaped noise (broadband noise with the average spectrum of chorus), and (3) chorus-modulated noise (song-shaped noise multiplied by the broadband envelope from a chorus masker). The amount of masking and spatial unmasking depended on the masker and there was evidence of release from both energetic and informational masking. Spatial unmasking was greatest for the statistically similar chorus masker. For the two noise maskers, there was less spatial unmasking and it was wholly accounted for by the relative target and masker levels at the acoustically better ear. The results share many features with analogous results using speech targets, suggesting that spatial separation aids in the segregation of complex natural sounds through mechanisms that are not specific to speech.},

Given that attention operates on perceptual objects, this perceptual buildup may alter the efficacy of selective auditory attention over time. Here, we measured identification of a sequence of spoken target digits presented with distracter digits from other directions to investigate the dynamics of selective attention. Performance was better when the target location was fixed rather than changing between digits, even when listeners were cued as much as 1 s in advance about the position of each subsequent digit. Spatial continuity not only avoided well known costs associated with switching the focus of spatial attention, but also produced refinements in the spatial selectivity of attention across time. Continuity of target voice further enhanced this buildup of selective attention. Results suggest that when attention is sustained on one auditory object within a complex scene, attentional selectivity improves over time. Similar effects may come into play when attention is sustained on an object in a complex visual scene, especially in cases where visual object formation requires sustained attention.},

In separate experiments, human subjects either identified learned birdsongs in the presence of a chorus of unlearned songs or recalled strings of spoken digits in the presence of speech maskers. A visual cue indicating which loudspeaker (from an array of five) would contain the target improved accuracy for both kinds of stimuli. A cue indicating which time segment (out of a possible five) would contain the target also improved accuracy, but much more for birdsong than for speech.

  abstract      = {In noisy environments, we use auditory selective attention to actively ignore distracting sounds and select relevant information, as during a cocktail party to follow one particular conversation. The present electrophysiological study aims at deciphering the spatiotemporal organization of the effect of selective attention on the representation of concurrent sounds in the human auditory cortex. Sound onset asynchrony was manipulated to induce the segregation of two concurrent auditory streams. Each stream consisted of amplitude modulated tones at different carrier and modulation frequencies. Electrophysiological recordings were performed in epileptic patients with pharmacologically resistant partial epilepsy, implanted with depth electrodes in the temporal cortex. Patients were presented with the stimuli while they either performed an auditory distracting task or actively selected one of the two concurrent streams. Selective attention was found to affect steady-state responses in the primary auditory cortex, and transient and sustained evoked responses in secondary auditory areas. The results provide new insights on the neural mechanisms of auditory selective attention: stream selection during sound rivalry would be facilitated not only by enhancing the neural representation of relevant sounds, but also by reducing the representation of irrelevant information in the auditory cortex. Finally, they suggest a specialization of the left hemisphere in the attentional selection of fine-grained acoustic information.},

We recorded blood oxygenation signals from the temporal lobes of normal volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation with unstructured noise, frequency-modulated (FM) tones, reversed speech, pseudowords and words. For all conditions, subjects performed a material-nonspecific detection response when a train of stimuli began or ceased. Dorsal areas surrounding Heschl's gyrus bilaterally, particularly the planum temporale and dorsolateral superior temporal gyrus, were more strongly activated by FM tones than by noise, suggesting a role in processing simple temporally encoded auditory information. Distinct from these dorsolateral areas, regions centered in the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally were more activated by speech stimuli than by FM tones. Identical results were obtained in this region using words, pseudowords and reversed speech, suggesting that the speech-tones activation difference is due to acoustic rather than linguistic factors. In contrast, previous comparisons between word and nonword speech sounds showed left-lateralized activation differences in more ventral temporal and temporoparietal regions that are likely involved in processing lexical-semantic or syntactic information associated with words. The results indicate functional subdivision of the human lateral temporal cortex and provide a preliminary framework for understanding the cortical processing of speech sounds.},

Thus, two-point discrimination in vision is limited by the size of individual photoreceptors. Frequency selectivity is a basic property of neurons in the mammalian auditory pathway. However, just-noticeable differences of frequency are substantially smaller than the bandwidth of the peripheral sensors. Here we report that frequency tuning in single neurons recorded from human auditory cortex in response to random-chord stimuli is far narrower than that typically described in any other mammalian species (besides bats), and substantially exceeds that attributed to the human auditory periphery. Interestingly, simple spectral filter models failed to predict the neuronal responses to natural stimuli, including speech and music. Thus, natural sounds engage additional processing mechanisms beyond the exquisite frequency tuning probed by the random-chord stimuli.},

  abstract      = {Recent studies, conducted almost exclusively in primates, have shown that several cortical areas usually associated with modality-specific sensory processing are subject to influences from other senses. Here we demonstrate using single-unit recordings and estimates of mutual information that visual stimuli can influence the activity of units in the auditory cortex of anesthetized ferrets. In many cases, these units were also acoustically responsive and frequently transmitted more information in their spike discharge patterns in response to paired visual-auditory stimulation than when either modality was presented by itself. For each stimulus, this information was conveyed by a combination of spike count and spike timing. Even in primary auditory areas (primary auditory cortex [A1] and anterior auditory field [AAF]), approximately 15\% of recorded units were found to have nonauditory input. This proportion increased in the higher level fields that lie ventral to A1/AAF and was highest in the anterior ventral field, where nearly 50\% of the units were found to be responsive to visual stimuli only and a further quarter to both visual and auditory stimuli. Within each field, the pure-tone response properties of neurons sensitive to visual stimuli did not differ in any systematic way from those of visually unresponsive neurons. Neural tracer injections revealed direct inputs from visual cortex into auditory cortex, indicating a potential source of origin for the visual responses. Primary visual cortex projects sparsely to A1, whereas higher visual areas innervate auditory areas in a field-specific manner. These data indicate that multisensory convergence and integration are features common to all auditory cortical areas but are especially prevalent in higher areas.},

As previously reported, the primary auditory cortex, A1, and the anterior auditory field, AAF, are located on the middle ectosylvian gyrus. These areas exhibited a similar tonotopic organization, with high frequencies represented at the dorsal tip of the gyrus and low frequencies more ventrally, but differed in that AAF neurons had shorter response latencies than those in A1. On the basis of differences in frequency selectivity, temporal response properties and thresholds, we identified four more, previously undescribed fields. Two of these are located on the posterior ectosylvian gyrus and were tonotopically organized. Neurons in these areas responded robustly to tones, but had longer latencies, more sustained responses and a higher incidence of non-monotonic rate-level functions than those in the primary fields. Two further auditory fields, which were not tonotopically organized, were found on the anterior ectosylvian gyrus. Neurons in the more dorsal anterior area gave short-latency, transient responses to tones and were generally broadly tuned with a preference for high (>8 kHz) frequencies. Neurons in the other anterior area were frequently unresponsive to tones, but often responded vigorously to broadband noise. The presence of both tonotopic and non-tonotopic auditory cortical fields indicates that the organization of ferret auditory cortex is comparable to that seen in other mammals.},

First, naive animals were exposed to stimulus-reward pairings from the prior study. These yoked animals did not have to discriminate to be rewarded and did not learn the discrimination. The plasticity observed in the prior study did not occur. Second, the animals were classically conditioned to discriminate the same stimuli in a simplified format. Learning was accompanied by increased sensory response strength and an increased range of sensory inputs eliciting responses. The third study recreated the original operant discrimination, and selectivity for task targets increased. These studies demonstrate that cognitive association between sensory stimuli and reinforcers accompanies adult experience-dependent cortical plasticity and suggest that selectivity in representation and action are linked.},

Adult owl monkeys learned to discriminate tones higher than a standard frequency. Responses recorded from implanted microelectrodes initially exhibited broad spectral selectivity over a four-to-five octave range. With training, frequency discrimination thresholds changed from close to one octave to about 1/12 octave. Physiological recordings during the week in which the monkey came under behavioral control signaled by a drop in measured threshold had stronger responses to all frequencies. During the same week, A1 neural responses to target stimuli increased relative to standard and nontarget stimuli. This emergent difference in responsiveness persisted throughout the subsequent weeks of behavioral training. These data suggest that behavioral responses to stimuli modulate responsiveness in primary cortical areas.},

Therefore, synchronized firing constitutes a significant event for postsynaptic neurons and is likely to play a role in neuronal information processing. Physiological data on synchronized firing in cortical networks are based primarily on paired recordings and cross-correlation analysis. However, pair-wise correlations among all inputs onto a postsynaptic neuron do not uniquely determine the distribution of simultaneous postsynaptic events. We develop a framework in order to calculate the amount of synchronous firing that, based on maximum entropy, should exist in a homogeneous neural network in which the neurons have known pair-wise correlations and higher-order structure is absent. According to the distribution of maximal entropy, synchronous events in which a large proportion of the neurons participates should exist even in the case of weak pair-wise correlations. Network simulations also exhibit these highly synchronous events in the case of weak pair-wise correlations. If such a group of neurons provides input to a common postsynaptic target, these network bursts may enhance the impact of this input, especially in the case of a high postsynaptic threshold. The proportion of neurons participating in synchronous bursts can be approximated by our method under restricted conditions. When these conditions are not fulfilled, the spike trains have less than maximal entropy, which is indicative of the presence of higher-order structure. In this situation, the degree of synchronicity cannot be derived from the pair-wise correlations.},

  abstract      = {In the early visual system, a contrast gain control mechanism sets the gain of responses based on the locally prevalent contrast. The measure of contrast used by this adaptation mechanism is commonly assumed to be the standard deviation of light intensities relative to the mean (root-mean-square contrast). A number of alternatives, however, are possible. For example, the measure of contrast might depend on the absolute deviations relative to the mean, or on the prevalence of the darkest or lightest intensities. We investigated the statistical computation underlying this measure of contrast in the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus, which relays signals from retina to cortex. Borrowing a method from psychophysics, we recorded responses to white noise stimuli whose distribution of intensities was precisely varied. We varied the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution of intensities while keeping the mean luminance constant. We found that gain strongly depends on the standard deviation of the distribution. At constant standard deviation, moreover, gain is invariant to changes in skewness or kurtosis. These findings held for both ON and OFF cells, indicating that the measure of contrast is independent of the range of stimulus intensities signaled by the cells. These results confirm the long-held assumption that contrast gain control computes root-mean-square contrast. They also show that contrast gain control senses the full distribution of intensities and leaves unvaried the relative responses of the different cell types. The advantages to visual processing of this remarkably specific computation are not entirely known.},

  abstract      = {Information theory quantifies how much information a neural response carries about the stimulus. This can be compared to the information transferred in particular models of the stimulus-response function and to maximum possible information transfer. Such comparisons are crucial because they validate assumptions present in any neurophysiological analysis. Here we review information-theory basics before demonstrating its use in neural coding. We show how to use information theory to validate simple stimulus-response models of neural coding of dynamic stimuli. Because these models require specification of spike timing precision, they can reveal which time scales contain information in neural coding. This approach shows that dynamic stimuli can be encoded efficiently by single neurons and that each spike contributes to information transmission. We argue, however, that the data obtained so far do not suggest a temporal code, in which the placement of spikes relative to each other yields additional information.},

Strictly speaking, however, a peak merely indicates that the two spike trains were not independent. Two biologically plausible ways of departing from independence that are capable of generating peaks very similar to spike timing peaks are described here: covariations over trials in response latency and covariations over trials in neuronal excitability. Since peaks due to these interactions can be similar to spike timing peaks, interpreting a correlogram may be a problem with ambiguous solutions. What peak shapes do latency or excitability interactions generate? When are they similar to spike timing peaks? When can they be ruled out from having caused an observed correlogram peak? These are the questions addressed here. The previous article in this issue proposes quantitative methods to tell cases apart when latency or excitability covariations cannot be ruled out.},

  abstract      = {1. The tail of the caudate nucleus and adjacent ventral putamen (ventrocaudal neostriatum) are major projection sites of the extrastriate visual cortex. Visual information is then relayed, directly or indirectly, to a variety of structures with motor functions. To test for a role of the ventrocaudal neostriatum in stimulus-response association learning, or habit formation, neuronal responses were recorded while monkeys performed a visual discrimination task. Additional data were collected from cells in cortical area TF, which serve as a comparison and control for the caudate data. 2. Two monkeys were trained to perform an asymmetrically reinforced go-no go visual discrimination. The stimuli were complex colored patterns, randomly assigned to be either positive or negative. The monkey was rewarded with juice for releasing a bar when a positive stimulus was presented, whereas a negative stimulus signaled that no reward was available and that the monkey should withhold its response. Neuronal responses were recorded both while the monkey performed the task with previously learned stimuli and while it learned the task with new stimuli. In some cases, responses were recorded during reversal learning. 3. There was no evidence that cells in the ventrocaudal neostriatum were influenced by the reward contingencies of the task. Cells did not fire preferentially to the onset of either positive or negative stimuli; neither did cells fire in response to the reward itself or in association with the motor response of the monkey. Only visual responses were apparent. 4. The visual properties of cells in these structures resembled those of cells in some of the cortical areas projecting to them. Most cells responded selectively to different visual stimuli. The degree of stimulus selectivity was assessed with discriminant analysis and was found to be quantitatively similar to that of inferior temporal cells tested with similar stimuli. Likewise, like inferior temporal cells, many cells in the ventrocaudal neostriatum had large, bilateral receptive fields. Some cells had ``doughnut''-shaped receptive fields, with stronger responses in the periphery of both visual fields than at the fovea, similar to the fields of some cells in the superior temporal polysensory area. Although the absence of task-specific responses argues that ventrocaudal neostriatal cells are not themselves the mediators of visual learning in the task employed, their cortical-like visual properties suggest that they might relay visual information important for visuomotor plasticity in other structures.

  abstract      = {1. Hebbian or associative synaptic plasticity has been proposed to play an important role in learning and memory. Whereas many behaviorally relevant stimuli are time-varying, most experimental and theoretical work on synaptic plasticity has focused on stimuli or induction protocols without temporal structure. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that associative plasticity sensitive to only the conjunction of pre- and postsynaptic activity is not an effective learning rule for networks required to learn time-varying stimuli. Our goal in the current experiment was to determine whether associative long-term potentiation (LTP) is sensitive to temporal structure. We examined whether the presentation of unpaired presynaptic pulses in addition to paired pre- and postsynaptic activity altered the induction of associative LTP. 2. By using intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells, associative long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced in a control pathway by pairing a single presynaptic pulse with postsynaptic depolarization every 5 s (50-70 x). The experimental pathway received the same training, with additional unpaired presynaptic pulses delivered in close temporal proximity, either after or before associative pairing. Five separate sets of experiments were performed with intervals of -200, -50, +50, +200, or +800 ms. Negative intervals indicate that the unpaired presynaptic pulse was presented before the depolarizing pulse. Our results showed that the presence of unpaired presynaptic pulses, occurring either before or after pairing, did not significantly alter the magnitude of LTP. 3. The experimental design permitted an analysis of whether changes in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) occur as a result of associative LTP. The average degree of PPF was the same before and after LTP. However, there was a significant inverse correlation between the initial degree of PPF and the degree of PPF after LTP. There was no relationship between the change in PPF, and whether the first or second pulse had been paired with depolarization. 4. These results indicate that the presence of unpaired presynaptic pulses does not alter the induction of synaptic plasticity, suggesting that plasticity of the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse is primarily conjunctive rather than correlative.},

  abstract      = {It has been clear for almost two decades that cortical representations in adult animals are not fixed entities, but rather, are dynamic and are continuously modified by experience. The cortex can preferentially allocate area to represent the particular peripheral input sources that are proportionally most used. Alterations in cortical representations appear to underlie learning tasks dependent on the use of the behaviorally important peripheral inputs that they represent. The rules governing this cortical representational plasticity following manipulations of inputs, including learning, are increasingly well understood. In parallel with developments in the field of cortical map plasticity, studies of synaptic plasticity have characterized specific elementary forms of plasticity, including associative long-term potentiation and long-term depression of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Investigators have made many important strides toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of these fundamental plasticity processes and toward defining the learning rules that govern their induction. The fields of cortical synaptic plasticity and cortical map plasticity have been implicitly linked by the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity underlies cortical map reorganization. Recent experimental and theoretical work has provided increasingly stronger support for this hypothesis. The goal of the current paper is to review the fields of both synaptic and cortical map plasticity with an emphasis on the work that attempts to unite both fields. A second objective is to highlight the gaps in our understanding of synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical representational plasticity.},

The responses to both stimulus ensembles were well described as rate-modulated Poisson processes but with very high precision (approximately 3 ms) modulation functions underlying the time-varying responses. Information-theoretic analysis revealed that the responses encoded only approximately 1 bit/s about constant-velocity stimuli but up to 29 bits/s about the time-varying stimuli. Analysis of local field potentials revealed that part of the residual response variability arose from ``noise'' sources extrinsic to the neuron. Our results demonstrate that extrastriate neurons in alert primates can encode the fine temporal structure of visual stimuli.},

Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron-electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

Sixty age-matched adults were recruited, with 15 each assigned to a healthy adult control group, a healthy musician control group, a tendinitis group, or a focal dystonia group. Four sensory motor subtests from the Sensory Integration and Praxis Test were given to the subjects according to a standardized protocol. Using multiple one-factor analyses of variance in the parametric or nonparametric mode followed by post hoc pairwise testing, no significant differences were found between the healthy controls and the musician controls. On the test of kinesthesia, using the left hand, subjects with tendinitis performed significantly worse than controls and subjects with focal dystonia. Compared with controls, subjects with focal dystonia did significantly worse on graphesthesia and manual form perception (part 1 and part 2). Subjects with focal dystonia also did significantly worse than subjects with tendinitis when using the left hand on graphesthesia and manual form perception (part 2). When treating patients with repetitive strain injury, discriminative sensory motor skills must be carefully assessed and may need to be addressed as part of an effective treatment program.},

A portion of these spatially selective mirror neurons encode space according to a metric representation, whereas other neurons encode space in operational terms, changing their properties according to the possibility that the monkey will interact with the object. These results suggest that a set of mirror neurons encodes the observed motor acts not only for action understanding, but also to analyze such acts in terms of features that are relevant to generating appropriate behaviors.},

This microcircuit is thought to underlie the computations required for complex behavior. Despite the absence of a six-layered cortex, birds are capable of complex cognition and behavior. In addition, the avian auditory pallium is composed of adjacent information-processing regions with genetically identified neuron types and projections among regions comparable with those found in the neocortex. Here, we show that the avian auditory pallium exhibits the same information-processing principles that define the canonical cortical microcircuit, long thought to have evolved only in mammals. These results suggest that the canonical cortical microcircuit evolved in a common ancestor of mammals and birds and provide a physiological explanation for the evolution of neural processes that give rise to complex behavior in the absence of cortical lamination.},

  abstract      = {Many animals exhibit flexible behaviors that they can adjust to increase reward or avoid harm (learning by positive or aversive reinforcement). But what neural mechanisms allow them to restore their original behavior (motor program) after reinforcement is withdrawn? One possibility is that motor restoration relies on brain areas that have a role in memorization but no role in either motor production or in sensory processing relevant for expressing the behavior and its refinement. We investigated the role of a higher auditory brain area in the songbird for modifying and restoring the stereotyped adult song. We exposed zebra finches to aversively reinforcing white noise stimuli contingent on the pitch of one of their stereotyped song syllables. In response, birds significantly changed the pitch of that syllable to avoid the aversive reinforcer. After we withdrew reinforcement, birds recovered their original song within a few days. However, we found that large bilateral lesions in the caudal medial nidopallium (NCM, a high auditory area) impaired recovery of the original pitch even several weeks after withdrawal of the reinforcing stimuli. Because NCM lesions spared both successful noise-avoidance behavior and birds' auditory discrimination ability, our results show that NCM is not needed for directed motor changes or for auditory discriminative processing, but is implied in memorizing or recalling the memory of the recent song target.},

  abstract      = {Simple cells in the primary visual cortex often appear to compute a weighted sum of the light intensity distribution of the visual stimuli that fall on their receptive fields. A linear model of these cells has the advantage of simplicity and captures a number of basic aspects of cell function. It, however, fails to account for important response nonlinearities, such as the decrease in response gain and latency observed at high contrasts and the effects of masking by stimuli that fail to elicit responses when presented alone. To account for these nonlinearities we have proposed a normalization model, which extends the linear model to include mutual shunting inhibition among a large number of cortical cells. Shunting inhibition is divisive, and its effect in the model is to normalize the linear responses by a measure of stimulus energy. To test this model we performed extracellular recordings of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques. We presented large stimulus sets consisting of (1) drifting gratings of various orientations and spatiotemporal frequencies; (2) plaids composed of two drifting gratings; and (3) gratings masked by full-screen spatiotemporal white noise. We derived expressions for the model predictions and fitted them to the physiological data. Our results support the normalization model, which accounts for both the linear and the nonlinear properties of the cells. An alternative model, in which the linear responses are subject to a compressive nonlinearity, did not perform nearly as well.},

  abstract      = {In autism, severe abnormalities in social behavior coexist with aberrant attention and deficient language. In the attentional domain, attention to people and socially relevant stimuli is impaired the most. Because socially meaningful stimulus events are physically complex, a deficiency in sensory processing of complex stimuli has been suggested to contribute to aberrant attention and language in autism. This study used event-related brain potentials (ERP) to examine the sensory and early attentional processing of sounds of different complexity in high-functioning children with autism. Acoustically matched simple tones, complex tones, and vowels were presented in separate oddball sequences, in which a repetitive ``standard'' sound was occasionally replaced by an infrequent ``deviant'' sound differing from the standard in frequency (by 10\%). In addition to sensory responses, deviant sounds elicited an ERP index of automatic sound-change discrimination, the mismatch negativity, and an ERP index of attentional orienting, the P3a. The sensory sound processing was intact in the high-functioning children with autism and was not affected by sound complexity or ``speechness.'' In contrast, their involuntary orienting was affected by stimulus nature. It was normal to both simple- and complex-tone changes but was entirely abolished by vowel changes. These results demonstrate that, first, auditory orienting deficits in autism cannot be explained by sensory deficits and, second, that orienting deficit in autism might be speech-sound specific.},

A powerful example of this phenomenon is categorical speech perception, in which a continuum of acoustically varying sounds is transformed into perceptually distinct phoneme categories. We found that the neural representation of speech sounds is categorically organized in the human posterior superior temporal gyrus. Using intracranial high-density cortical surface arrays, we found that listening to synthesized speech stimuli varying in small and acoustically equal steps evoked distinct and invariant cortical population response patterns that were organized by their sensitivities to critical acoustic features. Phonetic category boundaries were similar between neurometric and psychometric functions. Although speech-sound responses were distributed, spatially discrete cortical loci were found to underlie specific phonetic discrimination. Our results provide direct evidence for acoustic-to-higher order phonetic level encoding of speech sounds in human language receptive cortex.},

We measured information content and stimulus-induced redundancy in the neural responses to a set of natural sounds in three successive stations of the auditory pathway-inferior colliculus (IC), auditory thalamus (MGB), and primary auditory cortex (A1). Information about stimulus identity was somewhat reduced in single A1 and MGB neurons relative to single IC neurons, when information is measured using spike counts, latency, or temporal spiking patterns. However, most of this difference was due to differences in firing rates. On the other hand, IC neurons were substantially more redundant than A1 and MGB neurons. IC redundancy was largely related to frequency selectivity. Redundancy reduction may be a generic organization principle of neural systems, allowing for easier readout of the identity of complex stimuli in A1 relative to IC.},

Here, we examined the relationship between the heterogeneity of neuronal responses and population coding.

Thus, the heterogeneity of neuronal responses is in fact beneficial for sensory coding when stimuli are decoded from the population response.},

We then evaluated the ability of different decoding rules to detect the target from the measured neural responses. We found that small visual targets elicit widespread responses in V1, and that response variability at distant sites is highly correlated. These correlations render most previously proposed decoding rules inefficient relative to one that uses spatially antagonistic center-surround summation. This optimal decoder consistently outperformed the monkey in the detection task, demonstrating the sensitivity of our techniques. Overall, our results suggest an unexpected role for inhibitory mechanisms in efficient decoding of neural population responses.},

Antidromically activated neurons (n = 37) and a sample of the overall population of MST neurons (n = 110) then were studied during pursuit eye movements across a dark background and during laminar motion of a large random-dot texture and optic flow expansion and contraction during fixation. Antidromically activated neurons showed direction tuning during pursuit (25/37), during laminar image motion (21/37), or both (16/37). Of 27 neurons tested with optic flow stimuli, 14 showed tuning for optic flow expansion (n = 10) or contraction (n = 4). There were no statistically significant differences in the response properties of the antidromically activated and control samples. Preferred directions for pursuit and laminar image motion did not show any statistically significant biases, and the preferred directions for eye versus image motion in each sample tended to be equally divided between aligned and opposed. There were small differences between the control and antidromically activated populations in preferred speeds for laminar motion and optic flow; these might have reached statistical significance with larger samples of antidromically activated neurons. We conclude that the population of MST neurons projecting to the FPA is highly diverse and quite similar to the general population of neurons in MST.},

Increasing the flash separation degrades the quality of motion, but for some separations evoked larger smooth pursuit responses from both humans and monkeys than did smooth motion. The same flash separations also produced an increase in perceived speed in humans. Recordings from single neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of awake monkeys revealed a potential basis for the illusion in the population response. Apparent motion produced diminished neural responses relative to smooth motion. However, neurons with slow preferred speeds were more affected than were those with fast preferred speeds. Increasing the flash separation thus caused the population response to become diminished in amplitude and to shift so that the most active neurons had higher preferred speeds. The entire constellation of effects of apparent motion on the magnitude and latency of the initial pursuit response was accounted for if the MT population response was decoded by (1) creating an opponent motion signal for each neuron by treating its preferred and opposite direction responses as those of a pair of oppositely tuned neurons and (2) computing the vector average of these opponent motion signals. Other ways of decoding the population response recorded in MT failed to account for one or more aspects of behavior. We conclude that the effects of apparent motion on both pursuit and perception can be accounted for if target speed is estimated from the MT population response by a neural computation that implements a vector average based on opponent motion.},

  abstract      = {Visual attention can improve behavioral performance by allowing observers to focus on the important information in a complex scene. Attention also typically increases the firing rates of cortical sensory neurons. Rate increases improve the signal-to-noise ratio of individual neurons, and this improvement has been assumed to underlie attention-related improvements in behavior. We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead, over 80\% of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons. These results suggest that the representation of sensory information in populations of neurons and the way attention affects the sensitivity of the population may only be understood by considering the interactions between neurons.},

Changes in the correlated firing of pairs of neurons may provide a metric of changes in functional circuitry during behavior. We studied dynamic changes in functional circuitry by analyzing the noise correlations of simultaneously recorded MT neurons in two behavioral contexts: one that promotes cooperative interactions between the two neurons and another that promotes competitive interactions. We found that identical visual stimuli give rise to differences in noise correlation in the two contexts, suggesting that MT neurons receive inputs of central origin whose strength changes with the task structure. The data are consistent with a mixed feature-based attentional strategy model in which the animal sometimes alternates attention between opposite directions of motion and sometimes attends to the two directions simultaneously.},

  abstract      = {Stimulus-specific neuronal responses are a striking characteristic of several sensory systems, although the synaptic mechanisms underlying their generation are not well understood. The songbird nucleus HVC (used here as a proper name) contains projection neurons (PNs) that fire temporally sparse bursts of action potentials to playback of the bird's own song (BOS) but are essentially silent when presented with other acoustical stimuli. To understand how such remarkable stimulus specificity emerges, it is necessary to compare the auditory-evoked responsiveness of the afferents of HVC with synaptic responses in identified HVC neurons. We found that inactivating the interfacial nucleus of the nidopallium (NIf) could eliminate all auditory-evoked subthreshold activity in both HVC PN types, consistent with NIf serving as the major auditory afferent of HVC. Simultaneous multiunit extracellular recordings in NIf and intracellular recordings in HVC revealed that NIf population activity and HVC subthreshold responses were similar in their selectivity for BOS and that NIf spikes preceded depolarizations in all HVC cell types. These results indicate that information about the BOS as well as other auditory stimuli is transmitted synaptically from NIf to HVC. Unlike HVC PNs, however, HVC-projecting NIf neurons fire throughout playback of BOS as well as non-BOS stimuli. Therefore, temporally sparse BOS-evoked firing and enhanced BOS selectivity, manifested as an absence of suprathreshold responsiveness to non-BOS stimuli, emerge in HVC. The transformation to a sparse auditory representation parallels differences in NIf and HVC activity patterns seen during singing, which may point to a common mechanism for encoding sensory and motor representations of song.},

The role of Uva in influencing HVC auditory activity is unknown. Using in vivo extracellular and intracellular recordings in urethane-anesthetized zebra finches, we characterized the auditory properties of Uva and examined its influence on auditory activity in HVC and in the telencephalic nucleus interface (NIf), the main auditory afferent of HVC and a corecipient of Uva input. We found robust auditory activity in Uva and determined that Uva is innervated by the ventral nucleus of lateral lemniscus, an auditory brainstem component. Thus, Uva provides a direct linkage between the auditory brainstem and HVC. Although low-frequency electrical stimulation in Uva elicited short-latency depolarizing postsynaptic potentials in HVC neurons, reversibly silencing Uva exerted little effect on BOS-evoked activity in HVC neurons. However, high-frequency stimulation in Uva suppressed auditory-evoked synaptic and suprathreshold activity in all HVC neuron types, a process accompanied by decreased input resistance of individual HVC neurons. Furthermore, high-frequency stimulation in Uva simultaneously suppressed auditory activity in HVC and NIf. These results suggest that Uva can gate auditory responses in HVC through a mechanism that involves inhibition local to HVC as well as withdrawal of auditory-evoked excitatory drive from NIf. Thus, Uva could play an important role in state-dependent gating of auditory activity in telencephalic sensorimotor structures important to learned vocal control.},

  abstract      = {The capacity to remember sequences is critical to many behaviors, such as navigation and communication. Adult humans readily recall the serial order of auditory items, and this ability is commonly understood to support, in part, the speech processing for language comprehension. Theories of short-term serial recall posit either use of absolute (hierarchically structured) or relative (associatively structured) position information. To date, neither of these classes of theories has been tested in a comparative auditory model. European starlings, a species of songbird, use temporally structured acoustic signals to communicate, and thus have the potential to serve as a model system for auditory working memory. Here, we explore the strategies that starlings use to detect the serial order of ecologically valid acoustic communication signals and the limits on their capacities to do so. Using a two-alternative choice operant procedure, we demonstrate that starlings can attend to the serial ordering of at least four song elements (motifs) and can use this information to classify differently ordered sequences of motifs. Removing absolute position cues from sequences while leaving relative position cues intact, causes recognition to fail. We then show that starlings can, however, recognize motif-sequences using only relative position cues, but only under rigid circumstances. The data are consistent with a strong learning bias against relative position information, and suggest that recognition of structured vocal signals in this species is inherently hierarchical.},

  abstract      = {Since Chomsky's pioneering work on syntactic structures, comparative psychologists interested in the study of language evolution have targeted pattern complexity, using formal mathematical grammars, as the key to organizing language-relevant cognitive processes across species. This focus on formal syntactic complexity, however, often disregards the close interaction in real-world signals between the structure of a pattern and its constituent elements. Whether such features of natural auditory signals shape pattern generalization is unknown. In the present paper, we train birds to recognize differently patterned strings of natural signals (song motifs). Instead of focusing on the complexity of the overtly reinforced patterns, we ask how the perceptual groupings of pattern elements influence the generalization pattern knowledge. We find that learning and perception of training patterns is agnostic to the perceptual features of underlying elements. Surprisingly, however, these same features constrain the generalization of pattern knowledge, and thus its broader use. Our results demonstrate that the restricted focus of comparative language research on formal models of syntactic complexity is, at best, insufficient to understand pattern use.},

We report on a new technique to achieve this using pressure injections of a mixture of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and the beta subunit of cholera toxin (Ctb). Adult male hamsters (n = 12) received 20-30-nl injections of either a 1:1 mixture of BDA (Sigma, 10\%) and Ctb (List Biological, 0.5\%), or each tracer by itself, into the medial amygdala. Adult female sheep (n = 4) received 200-300 nl of the combined tracer into the A15 region of the hypothalamus. After 1 (hamster) or 2 weeks' (sheep) survival, animals were perfused with 4\% paraformaldehyde. Sections were double-labeled, first for BDA histochemistry using nickel-enhanced DAB, then for Ctb using a PAP technique and unenhanced DAB. In all animals, combined injections resulted in clear and consistent patterns of both anterograde and retrograde labeling. Ctb immunoreactivity was distinct and easily distinguished from BDA labeling. There was no evidence for loss of sensitivity of either tracer due to the combined delivery; no differences were seen between combined or single tracer injections in numbers of retrogradely-labeled cells or in the distribution of anterogradely-labeled fibers. In summary, the combined delivery of BDA and Ctb is an easy and reliable technique for simultaneous afferent and efferent tract tracing in both small and large animals; it could potentially be combined with immunocytochemistry to determine the neurochemical content of labeled cells or fibers.},

Both emergent timing (motor) and temporal expectation (perceptual) are forms of implicit timing. Recent fMRI studies demonstrate discrete neural substrates for explicit and implicit timing. Specifically, basal ganglia are activated almost invariably by explicit timing, with co-activation of prefrontal, premotor and cerebellar areas being more context-dependent. Conversely, implicit perceptual timing (or ``temporal expectation'') recruits cortical action circuits, comprising inferior parietal and premotor areas, highlighting its role in the optimisation of prospective behaviour.},

Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18, 7426-7435]. In the present experiment, we explored the behavioural and anatomical correlates of temporal orienting to foveal visual stimuli, in order to eliminate any spatial attention confounds. We implemented a two-way factorial design in an event-related fMRI study to examine the factors of trial validity (predictability of target by cue), length of delay (cue-target interval), and their interaction. There were two distinct types of invalid trial: those where attention was automatically drawn to a premature target and those where attention was voluntarily shifted to a delayed time-point. Reaction times for valid trials were shorter than those for invalid trials, demonstrating appropriate allocation of attention to temporal cues. All trial-types activated a shared system, including frontoparietal areas bilaterally, showing that this network is consistently associated with attentional orienting and is not specific to spatial tasks. Distinct brain areas were sensitive to cue-target delays and to trial validity. Long cue-target intervals activated areas involved in motor preparation: supplementary motor cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. Invalid trials, where temporal expectancies were breached, showed enhanced activation of left parietal and frontal areas, and engagement of orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally. Finally, trial validity interacted with length of delay. Appearance of targets prematurely selectively activated visual extrastriate cortex; while postponement of target appearance selectively activated right prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that distinct brain areas are involved in redirecting attention based upon sensory events (bottom-up, exogenous shifts) and based upon cognitive expectations (top-down, endogenous shifts).},

A temporal analog of the covert spatial orientation task [Posner MI, Snyder CRR, Davidson BJ (1980) Attention and the detection of signals. J Exp Psychol Gen 109:160-174] was developed to compare the neural systems involved in directing attention to spatial locations versus time intervals. We asked whether there exists a general system for allocating attentional resources, independent of stimulus dimension, or whether functionally specialized brain regions are recruited for directing attention toward spatial versus temporal aspects of the environment. We measured brain activity in seven healthy volunteers by using positron emission tomography (PET) and in eight healthy volunteers by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The task manipulated cued attention to spatial locations (S) and temporal intervals (T) in a factorial design. Symbolic central cues oriented subjects toward S only (left or right), toward T only (300 msec or 1500 msec), toward both S and T simultaneously, or provided no information regarding S or T. Subjects also were scanned during a resting baseline condition. Behavioral data showed benefits and costs for performance during temporal attention similar to those established for spatial attention. Brain-imaging data revealed a partial overlap between neural systems involved in the performance of spatial versus temporal orientation of attention tasks. Additionally, hemispheric asymmetries revealed preferential right and left parietal activation for spatial and temporal attention, respectively. Parietal cortex was activated bilaterally by attending to both dimensions simultaneously. This is the first direct comparison of the neural correlates of attending to spatial versus temporal cues.},

  abstract      = {Cocktail parties, busy streets, and other noisy environments pose a difficult challenge to the auditory system: how to focus attention on selected sounds while ignoring others? Neurons of primary auditory cortex, many of which are sharply tuned to sound frequency, could help solve this problem by filtering selected sound information based on frequency-content. To investigate whether this occurs, we used high-resolution fMRI at 7 tesla to map the fine-scale frequency-tuning (1.5 mm isotropic resolution) of primary auditory areas A1 and R in six human participants. Then, in a selective attention experiment, participants heard low (250 Hz)- and high (4000 Hz)-frequency streams of tones presented at the same time (dual-stream) and were instructed to focus attention onto one stream versus the other, switching back and forth every 30 s. Attention to low-frequency tones enhanced neural responses within low-frequency-tuned voxels relative to high, and when attention switched the pattern quickly reversed. Thus, like a radio, human primary auditory cortex is able to tune into attended frequency channels and can switch channels on demand.},

  abstract      = {As sensory stimuli and behavioral demands change, the attentive brain quickly identifies task-relevant stimuli and associates them with appropriate motor responses. The effects of attention on sensory processing vary across task paradigms, suggesting that the brain may use multiple strategies and mechanisms to highlight attended stimuli and link them to motor action. To better understand factors that contribute to these variable effects, we studied sensory representations in primary auditory cortex (A1) during two instrumental tasks that shared the same auditory discrimination but required different behavioral responses, either approach or avoidance. In the approach task, ferrets were rewarded for licking a spout when they heard a target tone amid a sequence of reference noise sounds. In the avoidance task, they were punished unless they inhibited licking to the target. To explore how these changes in task reward structure influenced attention-driven rapid plasticity in A1, we measured changes in sensory neural responses during behavior. Responses to the target changed selectively during both tasks but did so with opposite sign. Despite the differences in sign, both effects were consistent with a general neural coding strategy that maximizes discriminability between sound classes. The dependence of the direction of plasticity on task suggests that representations in A1 change not only to sharpen representations of task-relevant stimuli but also to amplify responses to stimuli that signal aversive outcomes and lead to behavioral inhibition. Thus, top-down control of sensory processing can be shaped by task reward structure in addition to the required sensory discrimination.},

  abstract      = {In this study, we explored ways to account more accurately for responses of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) to natural sounds. The auditory cortex has evolved to extract behaviorally relevant information from complex natural sounds, but most of our understanding of its function is derived from experiments using simple synthetic stimuli. Previous neurophysiological studies have found that existing models, such as the linear spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF), fail to capture the entire functional relationship between natural stimuli and neural responses. To study this problem, we compared STRFs for A1 neurons estimated using a natural stimulus, continuous speech, with STRFs estimated using synthetic ripple noise. For about one-third of the neurons, we found significant differences between STRFs, usually in the temporal dynamics of inhibition and/or overall gain. This shift in tuning resulted primarily from differences in the coarse temporal structure of the speech and noise stimuli. Using simulations, we found that the stimulus dependence of spectro-temporal tuning can be explained by a model in which synaptic inputs to A1 neurons are susceptible to rapid nonlinear depression. This dynamic reshaping of spectro-temporal tuning suggests that synaptic depression may enable efficient encoding of natural auditory stimuli.},

  abstract      = {Populations of neurons in the retina, olfactory system, visual and somatosensory thalamus, and several cortical regions show temporal correlation between the discharge times of their action potentials (spike trains). Correlated firing has been linked to stimulus encoding, attention, stimulus discrimination, and motor behaviour. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying correlated spiking are poorly understood, and its coding implications are still debated. It is not clear, for instance, whether correlations between the discharges of two neurons are determined solely by the correlation between their afferent currents, or whether they also depend on the mean and variance of the input. We addressed this question by computing the spike train correlation coefficient of unconnected pairs of in vitro cortical neurons receiving correlated inputs. Notably, even when the input correlation remained fixed, the spike train output correlation increased with the firing rate, but was largely independent of spike train variability. With a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations using 'integrate-and-fire' neuron models we show that this relationship between output correlation and firing rate is robust to input heterogeneities. Finally, this overlooked relationship is replicated by a standard threshold-linear model, demonstrating the universality of the result. This connection between the rate and correlation of spiking activity links two fundamental features of the neural code.},

Similarly, when a texture field containing a hole is steadily viewed in peripheral vision (artificial scotoma), the hole appears to fill in with the surrounding texture in a matter of seconds, demonstrating that the visual system fills in information across regions where no information is available. Here we show that, in monkeys viewing a similar texture field with a hole, the responses of extrastriate visual neurons with receptive fields covering the hole increase gradually to a level comparable to that elicited by the same texture without a hole. The time course of these dynamic changes in activity parallels the time course of perceived filling-in of the hole by human observers, suggesting that this process mediates perceptual filling-in.},

  abstract      = {It is well established that multiple stimulus dimensions (e.g., orientation and spatial frequency) are mapped onto the surface of striate cortex. However, the detailed organization of neurons within a local region of striate cortex remains unclear. Within a vertical column, do all neurons have the same response selectivities? And if not, how do they most commonly differ and why? To address these questions, we recorded from nearby pairs of simple cells and made detailed spatiotemporal maps of their receptive fields. From these maps, we extracted and analyzed a variety of response metrics. Our results provide new insights into the local organization of striate cortex. First, we show that nearby neurons seldom have very similar receptive fields, when these fields are characterized in space and time. Thus, there may be less redundancy within a column than previously thought. Moreover, we show that correlated discharge increases with receptive field similarity; thus, the local dissimilarity between neurons may allow for noise reduction by response pooling. Second, we show that several response variables are clustered within striate cortex, including some that have not received much attention such as response latency and temporal frequency. We also demonstrate that other parameters are not clustered, including the spatial phase (or symmetry) of the receptive field. Third, we show that spatial phase is the single parameter that accounts for most of the difference between receptive fields of nearby neurons. We consider the implications of this local diversity of spatial phase for population coding and construction of higher-order receptive fields.},

When a single sensory stimulus drives many neurons to fire at elevated rates, the spikes of these neurons become tightly synchronized, which could be involved in 'binding' together individual firing-rate feature representations into a unified object percept. Here we demonstrate that the relative timing of cortical action potentials can signal stimulus features themselves, a function even more basic than feature grouping. Populations of neurons in the primary auditory cortex can coordinate the relative timing of their action potentials such that spikes occur closer together in time during continuous stimuli. In this way cortical neurons can signal stimuli even when their firing rates do not change. Population coding based on relative spike timing can systemically signal stimulus features, it is topographically mapped, and it follows the stimulus time course even where mean firing rate does not.},

  abstract      = {Previous studies have reported that some neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex respond selectively to highly specific complex objects. In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be ``detectors'' for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex.},

  abstract      = {Receptive fields of sensory neurons in the brain are usually restricted to a portion of the entire stimulus domain. At all levels of the gustatory neuraxis, however, there are many cells that are broadly tuned, i.e., they respond well to each of the basic taste qualities (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter). Although it might seem that this broad tuning precludes a major role for these cells in representing taste space, here we show the opposite--namely, that the tastant-specific temporal aspects (firing rate envelope and spike timing) of their responses enable each cell to represent the entire stimulus domain. Specifically, we recorded the response patterns of cells in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) to representatives of four basic taste qualities and their binary mixtures. We analyzed the temporal aspects of these responses, and used their similarities and differences to construct the taste space represented by each neuron. We found that for the more broadly tuned neurons in the NTS, the taste space is a systematic representation of the entire taste domain. That is, the taste space of these broadly tuned neurons is three dimensional, with basic taste qualities widely separated and binary mixtures placed close to their components. Further, the way that taste quality is represented by the firing rate envelope is consistent across the population of cells. Thus, the temporal characteristics of responses in the population of NTS neurons, especially those that are more broadly tuned, produce a comprehensive and logical representation of the taste world.},

  abstract      = {Theories of taste coding in the brain stem have been based on the idea that taste responses are integrated over time without regard to the temporal structure of the taste-evoked spike train. In the present experiment, the reliability of response rate across stimulus repetitions and the potential contribution of temporal coding to the discrimination of taste stimuli was examined. Taste stimuli representing the four basic taste qualities were presented repeatedly, and electrophysiological responses were recorded from single cells in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of anesthetized rats. Blocks of the four tastants were repeated for as long as the cell remained isolated. Nineteen cells were recorded with between 8 and 27 repetitions of each stimulus. Response magnitude to a given tastant varied widely within some NTS cells. This impacted the determination of both the breadth of tuning and best stimulus for a given cell. The contribution of spike timing and the pattern of interspike intervals to discrimination of taste stimuli was evaluated by an information-theoretic approach based on two families of metrics. Spike timing significantly contributed to the discrimination of taste qualities in 10 of 19 (53\%) cells. This contribution was especially notable during the initial 2 s of the response. Those cells that showed the most variable firing rates in response to repetition of taste stimuli tended to show the largest contribution of temporal coding. These results suggest that, in addition to response rate, the temporal parameters of responses may convey information about taste stimuli in the NTS.},

  abstract      = {A visual scene is perceived in terms of visual objects. Similar ideas have been proposed for the analogous case of auditory scene analysis, although their hypothesized neural underpinnings have not yet been established. Here, we address this question by recording from subjects selectively listening to one of two competing speakers, either of different or the same sex, using magnetoencephalography. Individual neural representations are seen for the speech of the two speakers, with each being selectively phase locked to the rhythm of the corresponding speech stream and from which can be exclusively reconstructed the temporal envelope of that speech stream. The neural representation of the attended speech dominates responses (with latency near 100 ms) in posterior auditory cortex. Furthermore, when the intensity of the attended and background speakers is separately varied over an 8-dB range, the neural representation of the attended speech adapts only to the intensity of that speaker but not to the intensity of the background speaker, suggesting an object-level intensity gain control. In summary, these results indicate that concurrent auditory objects, even if spectrotemporally overlapping and not resolvable at the auditory periphery, are neurally encoded individually in auditory cortex and emerge as fundamental representational units for top-down attentional modulation and bottom-up neural adaptation.},

  abstract      = {The cortical representation of the acoustic features of continuous speech is the foundation of speech perception. In this study, noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings are obtained from human subjects actively listening to spoken narratives, in both simple and cocktail party-like auditory scenes. By modeling how acoustic features of speech are encoded in ongoing MEG activity as a spectrotemporal response function, we demonstrate that the slow temporal modulations of speech in a broad spectral region are represented bilaterally in auditory cortex by a phase-locked temporal code. For speech presented monaurally to either ear, this phase-locked response is always more faithful in the right hemisphere, but with a shorter latency in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated ear. When different spoken narratives are presented to each ear simultaneously (dichotic listening), the resulting cortical neural activity precisely encodes the acoustic features of both of the spoken narratives, but slightly weakened and delayed compared with the monaural response. Critically, the early sensory response to the attended speech is considerably stronger than that to the unattended speech, demonstrating top-down attentional gain control. This attentional gain is substantial even during the subjects' very first exposure to the speech mixture and therefore largely independent of knowledge of the speech content. Together, these findings characterize how the spectrotemporal features of speech are encoded in human auditory cortex and establish a single-trial-based paradigm to study the neural basis underlying the cocktail party phenomenon.},

  abstract      = {The functional role of neural synchrony is reflected in cortical tonotopic map reorganization and in the emergence of pathological phenomena such as tinnitus. First of all experimenter-centered and subject-centered views of neural activity will be contrasted; this argues against the use of stimulus-correction procedures and favors the use of a correction procedure based on neural activity without reference to stimulus timing. Within a cortical column neurons fired synchronously with on average about 6\% of their spikes in a 1 ms bin and occasionally showing 30\% or more of such coincident spikes. For electrode separations exceeding 200 microm the average peak correlation strength only occasionally reached 3\%. The experimental evidence for coincidence of neural activity, neural correlation and neural synchrony shows that horizontal fibers activity can induce strong neural correlations. Cortico-cortical connections for a large part connect cell groups with characteristic frequencies differing by more than one octave. Such neurons have generally non-overlapping receptive fields but still can have sizeable peak cross-correlations. Correlated neural activity and heterotopic neural interconnections are presented as the substrates for cortical reorganization; increased neural synchrony and tonotopic map reorganization go hand in hand. This links cortical reorganization with hypersynchrony that can be considered as an important driving force underlying tinnitus.},

  abstract      = {The human visual system is capable of recognizing complex objects even when their appearances change drastically under various viewing conditions. Especially in the higher cortical areas, the sensory neurons reflect such functional capacity in their selectivity for complex visual features and invariance to certain object transformations, such as image translation. Due to the strong nonlinearities necessary to achieve both the selectivity and invariance, characterizing and predicting the response patterns of these neurons represents a formidable computational challenge. A related problem is that such neurons are poorly driven by randomized inputs, such as white noise, and respond strongly only to stimuli with complex high-order correlations, such as natural stimuli. Here we describe a novel two-step optimization technique that can characterize both the shape selectivity and the range and coarseness of position invariance from neural responses to natural stimuli. One step in the optimization is finding the template as the maximally informative dimension given the estimated spatial location where the response could have been triggered within each image. The estimates of the locations that triggered the response are updated in the next step. Under the assumption of a monotonic relationship between the firing rate and stimulus projections on the template at a given position, the most likely location is the one that has the largest projection on the estimate of the template. The algorithm shows quick convergence during optimization, and the estimation results are reliable even in the regime of small signal-to-noise ratios. When we apply the algorithm to responses of complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) to natural movies, we find that responses of the majority of cells were significantly better described by translation-invariant models based on one template compared with position-specific models with several relevant features.},

  abstract      = {Various types of neural-based signals, such as EEG, local field potentials and intracellular synaptic potentials, integrate multiple sources of activity distributed across large assemblies. They have in common a power-law frequency-scaling structure at high frequencies, but it is still unclear whether this scaling property is dominated by intrinsic neuronal properties or by network activity. The latter case is particularly interesting because if frequency-scaling reflects the network state it could be used to characterize the functional impact of the connectivity. In intracellularly recorded neurons of cat primary visual cortex in vivo, the power spectral density of V(m) activity displays a power-law structure at high frequencies with a fractional scaling exponent. We show that this exponent is not constant, but depends on the visual statistics used to drive the network. To investigate the determinants of this frequency-scaling, we considered a generic recurrent model of cortex receiving a retinotopically organized external input. Similarly to the in vivo case, our in computo simulations show that the scaling exponent reflects the correlation level imposed in the input. This systematic dependence was also replicated at the single cell level, by controlling independently, in a parametric way, the strength and the temporal decay of the pairwise correlation between presynaptic inputs. This last model was implemented in vitro by imposing the correlation control in artificial presynaptic spike trains through dynamic-clamp techniques. These in vitro manipulations induced a modulation of the scaling exponent, similar to that observed in vivo and predicted in computo. We conclude that the frequency-scaling exponent of the V(m) reflects stimulus-driven correlations in the cortical network activity. Therefore, we propose that the scaling exponent could be used to read-out the ``effective'' connectivity responsible for the dynamical signature of the population signals measured at different integration levels, from Vm to LFP, EEG and fMRI.},

  abstract      = {To form a reliable, consistent, and accurate representation of the acoustic scene, a reasonable conjecture is that cortical neurons maintain stable receptive fields after an early period of developmental plasticity. However, recent studies suggest that cortical neurons can be modified throughout adulthood and may change their response properties quite rapidly to reflect changing behavioral salience of certain sensory features. Because claims of adaptive receptive field plasticity could be confounded by intrinsic, labile properties of receptive fields themselves, we sought to gauge spontaneous changes in the responses of auditory cortical neurons. In the present study, we examined changes in a series of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) gathered from single neurons in successive recordings obtained over time scales of 30-120 min in primary auditory cortex (A1) in the quiescent, awake ferret. We used a global analysis of STRF shape based on a large database of A1 receptive fields. By clustering this STRF space in a data-driven manner, STRF sequences could be classified as stable or labile. We found that >73\% of A1 neurons exhibited stable receptive field attributes over these time scales. In addition, we found that the extent of intrinsic variation in STRFs during the quiescent state was insignificant compared with behaviorally induced STRF changes observed during performance of spectral auditory tasks. Our results confirm that task-related changes induced by attentional focus on specific acoustic features were indeed confined to behaviorally salient acoustic cues and could be convincingly attributed to learning-induced plasticity when compared with ``spontaneous'' receptive field variability.},

  abstract      = {Although single units in primary auditory cortex (A1) exhibit accurate timing in their phasic response to the onset of sound (precision of a few milliseconds), paradoxically, they are unable to sustain synchronized responses to repeated stimuli at rates much beyond 20 Hz. To explore the relationship between these two aspects of cortical response, we designed a broadband stimulus with a slowly modulated spectrotemporal envelope riding on top of a rapidly modulated waveform (or fine structure). Using this stimulus, we quantified the ability of cortical cells to encode independently and simultaneously the stimulus envelope and fine structure. Specifically, by reverse-correlating unit responses with these two stimulus dimensions, we measured the spectrotemporal response fields (STRFs) associated with the processing of the envelope, the fine structure, and the complete stimulus. A1 cells respond well to the slow spectrotemporal envelopes and produce a wide variety of STRFs. In over 70\% of cases, A1 units also track the fine-structure modulations precisely, throughout the stimulus, and for frequencies up to several hundred Hertz. Such a dual response, however, is contingent on the cell being driven by both fast and slow modulations, in that the response to the slowly modulated envelope gates the expression of the fine structure. We also demonstrate that either a simplified model of synaptic depression and facilitation, and/or a cortical network of thalamic excitation and cortical inhibition can account for major trends in the observed findings. Finally, we discuss the potential functional significance and perceptual relevance of these coexistent, complementary dynamic response modes.},

  abstract      = {Attempts to relate the perceptual dimensions of timbre to quantitative acoustical dimensions have been tenuous, leading to claims that timbre is an emergent property, if measurable at all. Here, a three-pronged analysis shows that the timbre space of sustained instrument tones occupies 5 dimensions and that a specific combination of acoustic properties uniquely determines gestalt perception of timbre. Firstly, multidimensional scaling (MDS) of dissimilarity judgments generated a perceptual timbre space in which 5 dimensions were cross-validated and selected by traditional model comparisons. Secondly, subjects rated tones on semantic scales. A discriminant function analysis (DFA) accounting for variance of these semantic ratings across instruments and between subjects also yielded 5 significant dimensions with similar stimulus ordination. The dimensions of timbre space were then interpreted semantically by rotational and reflectional projection of the MDS solution into two DFA dimensions. Thirdly, to relate this final space to acoustical structure, the perceptual MDS coordinates of each sound were regressed with its joint spectrotemporal modulation power spectrum. Sound structures correlated significantly with distances in perceptual timbre space. Contrary to previous studies, most perceptual timbre dimensions are not the result of purely temporal or spectral features but instead depend on signature spectrotemporal patterns.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.},

The sensitivity of the model to frequency and amplitude transitions is achieved by applying a 2-dimensional rotatable receptive field to the set of spectrotemporally tuned neurons. We evaluated the model using data recorded in AI of anesthetized ferrets. We show that the model is able to fit the responses of AI units to variety of stimuli, including single tones, delayed 2-tone stimuli and various frequency-modulated tones, using only a small number of parameters. Furthermore, we show that the topographical order in maps of the model parameters is higher than in maps created from response indices extracted directly from the responses to any single stimulus.

  abstract      = {The sparseness of the encoding of stimuli by single neurons and by populations of neurons is fundamental to understanding the efficiency and capacity of representations in the brain, and was addressed as follows. The selectivity and sparseness of firing to visual stimuli of single neurons in the primate inferior temporal visual cortex were measured to a set of 20 visual stimuli including objects and faces in macaques performing a visual fixation task. Neurons were analysed with significantly different responses to the stimuli. The firing rate distribution of 36\% of the neurons was exponential. Twenty-nine percent of the neurons had too few low rates to be fitted by an exponential distribution, and were fitted by a gamma distribution. Interestingly, the raw firing rate distribution taken across all neurons fitted an exponential distribution very closely. The sparseness a (s) or selectivity of the representation of the set of 20 stimuli provided by each of these neurons (which takes a maximal value of 1.0) had an average across all neurons of 0.77, indicating a rather distributed representation. The sparseness of the representation of a given stimulus by the whole population of neurons, the population sparseness a (p), also had an average value of 0.77. The similarity of the average single neuron selectivity a (s) and population sparseness for any one stimulus taken at any one time a (p) shows that the representation is weakly ergodic. For this to occur, the different neurons must have uncorrelated tuning profiles to the set of stimuli.},

We found that middle face patch neurons detect and differentiate faces using a strategy that is both part based and holistic. Cells detected distinct constellations of face parts. Furthermore, cells were tuned to the geometry of facial features. Tuning was most often ramp-shaped, with a one-to-one mapping of feature magnitude to firing rate. Tuning amplitude depended on the presence of a whole, upright face and features were interpreted according to their position in a whole, upright face. Thus, cells in the middle face patch encode axes of a face space specialized for whole, upright faces.},

  abstract      = {Information processing in the visual cortex depends on complex and context sensitive patterns of interactions between neuronal groups in many different cortical areas. Methods used to date for disentangling this functional connectivity presuppose either linearity or instantaneous interactions, assumptions that are not necessarily valid. In this paper a general framework that encompasses both linear and non-linear modelling of neurophysiological time series data by means of Local Linear Non-linear Autoregressive models (LLNAR) is described. Within this framework a new test for non-linearity of time series and for non-linearity of directedness of neural interactions based on LLNAR is presented. These tests assess the relative goodness of fit of linear versus non-linear models via the bootstrap technique. Additionally, a generalised definition of Granger causality is presented based on LLNAR that is valid for both linear and non-linear systems. Finally, the use of LLNAR for measuring non-linearity and directional influences is illustrated using artificial data, reference data as well as local field potentials (LFPs) from macaque area TE. LFP data is well described by the linear variant of LLNAR. Models of this sort, including lagged values of the preceding 25 to 60 ms, revealed the existence of both uni- and bi-directional influences between recording sites.},

Recent studies showing rapid task-related changes in neuronal spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in primary auditory cortex of the behaving ferret are reviewed in the context of current research on cortical plasticity. Ferrets were trained on spectral tasks, including tone detection and two-tone discrimination, and on temporal tasks, including gap detection and click-rate discrimination. STRF changes could be measured on-line during task performance and occurred within minutes of task onset. During spectral tasks, there were specific spectral changes (enhanced response to tonal target frequency in tone detection and discrimination, suppressed response to tonal reference frequency in tone discrimination). However, only in the temporal tasks, the STRF was changed along the temporal dimension by sharpening temporal dynamics. In ferrets trained on multiple tasks, distinctive and task-specific STRF changes could be observed in the same cortical neurons in successive behavioral sessions. These results suggest that rapid task-related plasticity is an ongoing process that occurs at a network and single unit level as the animal switches between different tasks and dynamically adapts cortical STRFs in response to changing acoustic demands.},

We recorded neuronal responses in the primary auditory cortex of behaving ferrets that were trained to detect a target tone of any frequency. Cortical plasticity was quantified by measuring focal changes in each cell's spectrotemporal response field (STRF) in a series of passive and active behavioral conditions. STRF measurements were made simultaneously with task performance, providing multiple snapshots of the dynamic STRF during ongoing behavior. Attending to a specific target frequency during the detection task consistently induced localized facilitative changes in STRF shape, which were swift in onset. Such modulatory changes may enhance overall cortical responsiveness to the target tone and increase the likelihood of 'capturing' the attended target during the detection task. Some receptive field changes persisted for hours after the task was over and hence may contribute to long-term sensory memory.},

To explore this interaction, we compared activity in ferret frontal cortex and primary auditory cortex (A1) during auditory and visual tasks requiring discrimination between classes of reference and target stimuli. Frontal cortex responses were behaviorally gated, selectively encoded the timing and invariant behavioral meaning of target stimuli, could be rapid in onset, and sometimes persisted for hours following behavior. These results are consistent with earlier findings in A1 that attention triggered rapid, selective, persistent, task-related changes in spectrotemporal receptive fields. Simultaneously recorded local field potentials revealed behaviorally gated changes in inter-areal coherence that were selectively modulated between frontal cortex and focal regions of A1 that were responsive to target sounds. These results suggest that A1 and frontal cortex dynamically establish a functional connection during auditory behavior that shapes the flow of sensory information and maintains a persistent trace of recent task-relevant stimulus features.},

  abstract      = {Acoustic filter properties of A1 neurons can dynamically adapt to stimulus statistics, classical conditioning, instrumental learning and the changing auditory attentional focus. We have recently developed an experimental paradigm that allows us to view cortical receptive field plasticity on-line as the animal meets different behavioral challenges by attending to salient acoustic cues and changing its cortical filters to enhance performance. We propose that attention is the key trigger that initiates a cascade of events leading to the dynamic receptive field changes that we observe. In our paradigm, ferrets were initially trained, using conditioned avoidance training techniques, to discriminate between background noise stimuli (temporally orthogonal ripple combinations) and foreground tonal target stimuli. They learned to generalize the task for a wide variety of distinct background and foreground target stimuli. We recorded cortical activity in the awake behaving animal and computed on-line spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) of single neurons in A1. We observed clear, predictable task-related changes in STRF shape while the animal performed spectral tasks (including single tone and multi-tone detection, and two-tone discrimination) with different tonal targets. A different set of task-related changes occurred when the animal performed temporal tasks (including gap detection and click-rate discrimination). Distinctive cortical STRF changes may constitute a ``task-specific signature''. These spectral and temporal changes in cortical filters occur quite rapidly, within 2min of task onset, and fade just as quickly after task completion, or in some cases, persisted for hours. The same cell could multiplex by differentially changing its receptive field in different task conditions. On-line dynamic task-related changes, as well as persistent plastic changes, were observed at a single-unit, multi-unit and population level. Auditory attention is likely to be pivotal in mediating these task-related changes since the magnitude of STRF changes correlated with behavioral performance on tasks with novel targets. Overall, these results suggest the presence of an attention-triggered plasticity algorithm in A1 that can swiftly change STRF shape by transforming receptive fields to enhance figure/ground separation, by using a contrast matched filter to filter out the background, while simultaneously enhancing the salient acoustic target in the foreground. These results favor the view of a nimble, dynamic, attentive and adaptive brain that can quickly reshape its sensory filter properties and sensori-motor links on a moment-to-moment basis, depending upon the current challenges the animal faces. In this review, we summarize our results in the context of a broader survey of the field of auditory attention, and then consider neuronal networks that could give rise to this phenomenon of attention-driven receptive field plasticity in A1.},

  abstract      = {Auditory experience leads to myriad changes in processing in the central auditory system. We recently described task-related plasticity characterized by rapid modulation of spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) in ferret primary auditory cortex (A1) during tone detection. We conjectured that each acoustic task may have its own ``signature'' STRF changes, dependent on the salient cues that the animal must attend to perform the task. To discover whether other acoustic tasks could elicit changes in STRF shape, we recorded from A1 in ferrets also trained on a frequency discrimination task. Overall, we found a distinct pattern of STRF change, characterized by an expected selective enhancement at target tone frequency but also by an equally selective depression at reference tone frequency. When single-tone detection and frequency discrimination tasks were performed sequentially, neurons responded differentially to identical tones, reflecting distinct predictive values of stimuli in the two behavioral contexts. All results were observed in multiunit as well as single-unit recordings. Our findings provide additional evidence for the presence of adaptive neuronal responses in A1 that can swiftly change to reflect both sensory content and the changing behavioral meaning of incoming acoustic stimuli.},

  abstract      = {Receptive fields in primary auditory cortex (A1) can be rapidly and adaptively reshaped to enhance responses to salient frequency cues when using single tones as targets. To explore receptive field changes to more complex spectral patterns, we trained ferrets to detect variable, multitone targets in the context of background, rippled noise. Recordings from A1 of behaving ferrets showed a consistent pattern of plasticity, at both the single-neuron level and the population level, with enhancement for each component tone frequency and suppression for intertone frequencies. Plasticity was strongest near neuronal best frequency, rapid in onset, and slow to fade. Although attention may trigger cortical plasticity, the receptive field changes persisted after the behavioral task was completed. The observed comb filter plasticity is an example of an adaptive contrast matched filter, which may generally improve discriminability between foreground and background sounds and, we conjecture, may predict A1 cortical plasticity for any complex spectral target.},

Thresholds observed when time and amplitude differences applied to the target were ``reinforcing'' (favored the same ear, resulting in a lateralized position for the target) were not significantly different from thresholds obtained when differences were ``opposing'' (favored opposite ears, resulting in a centered position for the target). This irrelevance of differences in the perceived location of the target is a classic result for energetic maskers but had not previously been shown for informational maskers. However, this parallellism between the patterns of binaural release for energetic and informational maskers was not accompanied by high correlations between the patterns for individual listeners, supporting the idea that the mechanisms for binaural release from energetic and informational masking are fundamentally different.},

The singular exception is for disabilities in ``Sound quality and naturalness''. When binaural capacities are measured by traditional static masking level difference paradigms, relationships between compromised binaural capacity and self-reports of disability are largely absent. However, when masking level differences are assessed using dynamic parameters that are more representative of the conditions experienced in everyday living then significant associations between binaural capacities and self-reports of disability do emerge.

We recorded the responses of 26 pairs of adjacent complex cells in the primary visual cortex of two awake monkeys while using both a set of 16 bar-like stimuli, and a more complex set of 128 two-dimensional patterns. Linear regression showed that 40\% of the signal variance of one neuron was related to that of the other when the responses to the bar-like stimuli were considered. However, when the responses to the two-dimensional stimuli were included in the analysis, only 19\% of the signal variance of one neuron was related to that of the adjacent one, almost exactly the same results as found in IT. An information theoretic analysis gave similar results. We hypothesize that this trend toward independence of information processing by adjacent cortical neurons is a general organizational strategy used to maximize the amount of information carried in local groups.},

  abstract      = {There are at least three possibilities for encoding information in a small area of cortex. First, neurons could have identical characteristics, thus conveying redundant information; second, neurons could give different responses to the same stimuli, thus conveying independent information; or third, neurons could cooperate with each other to encode more information jointly than they do separately, that is, synergistically. We recorded from 28 pairs of neurons in inferior temporal cortex of behaving rhesus monkeys. Each pair was recorded from a single microelectrode. Both the magnitude and the temporal modulation of the responses were quantified. We separated the responses into signal (average response to each stimulus) and noise (deviation of each response from the average). Linear regression showed that an average of only 18.7\% of the magnitude of the signal carried by one neuron could be predicted from the magnitude of the other, and only 22.0\% could be predicted by including the temporal modulation. For the noise, the figures were 5.5\% and 6.3\%, respectively, even less than for the signal. Information theoretic analysis shows that the pairs of neurons we studied carried an average of 20\% redundant information. However, even this relatively small amount of redundancy places a severe upper limit on the information that can be transmitted by a neuronal pool. A pool of neurons for which each pair is mutually redundant to extent y can only carry a maximum of 1/y, here five times, as much information as one neuron alone. Information theoretic analysis gave no evidence for the presence of information as a function of both neurons considered together, that is, synergistic codes. Cross-correlation showed that at least 61\% of the neuronal pairs shared connections in some manner. Given these shared connections, if adjacent neurons had had identical characteristics, then the noise on the outputs of these neurons would have been highly correlated, and it would not be possible to separate the signal and noise. The severe impact of correlated noise and information redundancy leads us to propose that the processing carried out by these neurons evolved both to provide a rich description of many stimulus properties and simultaneously to minimize the redundancy in a local group of neurons. These two principles appear to be a major constraint on the organization of inferior temporal, and possibly all, cortex.},

Little is known however, about more specific processing within these regions especially during song-based perceptual behaviors. One hallmark of the caudal medial mesopallium and caudal medial nidopallium, areas analogous to mammalian secondary auditory cortical structures, is their robust expression of the immediate-early-gene zenk in response to conspecific songs. Using European starlings operantly trained to recognize the songs of individual conspecifics, we show that the levels and patterns of zenk protein expression in the caudal medial nidopallium and caudal medial mesopallium differ when song recognition demands are placed on the system. In the caudal medial mesopallium, expression is significantly elevated above basal levels during the recognition of familiar songs, the acquisition of novel associations for familiar songs, and the acquisition of novel song discriminations. In the caudal medial nidopallium, however, expression is significantly elevated above basal levels only during the acquisition of novel song discriminations. The results directly implicate the caudal medial nidopallium and caudal medial mesopallium in at least a portion of the auditory processes underlying vocal recognition. Moreover, the observed differences between these regions imply the functional localization (or at least the concentration) of different auditory processing mechanisms within the caudal medial nidopallium and the caudal medial mesopallium.},

  abstract      = {Among songbirds, the capacity to associate particular songs with particular singers (i.e., vocal recognition) forms the cognitive basis for more complex communication behaviors such as female choice and territoriality. In the present study, we combine operant conditioning techniques and excitotoxic lesions to the forebrain nucleus HVc to examine the role of this region in the discrimination, associative learning, and categorization of conspecific song. We trained adult male and female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to recognize simultaneously the songs of several conspecific males. Then, using a series of transfer procedures, we demonstrate that correct recognition does not generalize to song bouts containing novel motifs from familiar singers. This suggests that starlings do not make use of individually invariant source or filter characteristics for vocal recognition. We then lesioned a portion of HVc bilaterally with ibotenic acid, and exposed the birds to a series of manipulations testing the discrimination, associative learning, and categorization of conspecific song. The lesions attenuated song production among males, but retention of the basic recognition task (i.e., maintenance of the discrimination) was unaffected. However, when the response contingencies were reversed-as a test of associative learning independent of discrimination-the initial performance and subsequent learning rate were negatively correlated with the size of the HVc lesions. This suggests that HVc plays a role in the formation of associations between a song and some referent. The results of this study are discussed in light of earlier claims regarding the role of HVc in the perceptual processing of conspecific song.},

  abstract      = {The present study, using a systematic recording method that we recently developed, describes the behavior of the neurons of the vocal control nucleus HVC in response to a variety of acoustic stimuli in a songbird species with multiple song types, the European starling. Most neurons did not respond to any of the stimuli that were presented, and those neurons that did respond responded to a different number of stimuli and showed distinct response features. The latter were thus classified into 3 categories, according to the number of stimuli to which they responded. Although only intracellular data could unambiguously determine to which population the neurons we recorded belonged, these 3 categories might correspond to the 3 populations of neurons that have been previously described in the HVC. Interestingly, responsive neurons of the 3 categories appeared to mainly respond to stimuli that were not the bird's own song. However, most of the stimuli to which the HVC neurons responded correspond to sounds that are important in the everyday social life of the starlings. We thus discuss our results in relation to the social life of these birds, to possible species differences in the processing of communicative signals, and to methodological issues.},

  abstract      = {1. To investigate the functional significance of temporally correlated discharge between nearby cells in the visual cortex, we obtained receptive-field maps of correlated discharge for 68 cell pairs in kittens and cats. Discharge from cell pairs was measured by a single extracellular electrode. A reverse correlation procedure was used to relate neural discharge to particular stimuli within a random sequence of briefly flashed bright and dark bars. Bicellular receptive fields (BRFs) were mapped by applying reverse correlation to approximately synchronous discharge from two cells. Unicellular receptive fields (URFs) were simultaneously mapped by separately applying reverse correlation to the discharge of each cell. 2. The receptive fields of the two neurons within each pair were initially studied by varying the orientation and spatial frequency of drifting sinusoidal gratings. After these tests a random sequence of appropriately oriented bars was used to evoke discharge suitable for reverse correlation analysis. For most cell pairs, the temporal pattern or strength of correlated discharge produced by such stimulation is different from that observed with stimulation by sinusoidal gratings. This indicates that visually evoked correlated discharge between nearby cells is stimulus dependent. 3. BRFs were classified according to their pattern of spatial sensitivity into three groups that roughly correspond to the single-cell receptive-field types of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN; center-surround) and visual cortex (simple and complex). These classifications were compared with the receptive-field types of the single cells within each pair. LGN-type and simple-type BRFs were only seen for pairs in which at least one of the cells was simple. Conversely, complex-type BRFs were only seen for pairs in which at least one of the cells was complex. 4. Because the reverse correlation procedure can be used to characterize the spatiotemporal receptive-field structure of simple cells, we were able to compare both the spatial and temporal properties associated with the URFs and BRFs of simple cell pairs. The spatiotemporal structure of the BRF of a simple-cell pair can largely be predicted on the basis of the two URFs. Although this prediction suggests the possibility that BRFs are stimulus artifacts, a shuffle procedure, in which multiple repetitions of random sequences were presented, verifies the neural origin of BRFs. BRFs emerge from specific neural pathways and are not simply a consequence of unicellular response preferences. 5. Five measures were derived from the reverse correlation analysis of simple-cell receptive fields: width, duration, optimal spatial and temporal frequency, and optimal velocity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract      = {Uncovering the roles of neural feedback in the brain is an active area of experimental research. In songbirds, the telencephalic premotor nucleus HVC receives neural feedback from both forebrain and brain stem areas. Here we present a computational model of birdsong sequencing that incorporates HVC and associated nuclei and builds on the model of sparse bursting presented in our preceding companion paper. Our model embodies the hypotheses that 1) different networks in HVC control different syllables or notes of birdsong, 2) interneurons in HVC not only participate in sparse bursting but also provide mutual inhibition between networks controlling syllables or notes, and 3) these syllable networks are sequentially excited by neural feedback via the brain stem and the afferent thalamic nucleus Uva, or a similar feedback pathway. We discuss the model's ability to unify physiological, behavioral, and lesion results and we use it to make novel predictions that can be tested experimentally. The model suggests a neural basis for sequence variations, shows that stimulation in the feedback pathway may have different effects depending on the balance of excitation and inhibition at the input to HVC from Uva, and predicts deviations from uniform expansion of syllables and gaps during HVC cooling.},

  abstract      = {The telencephalic premotor nucleus HVC is situated at a critical point in the pattern-generating premotor circuitry of oscine songbirds. A striking feature of HVC's premotor activity is that its projection neurons burst extremely sparsely. Here we present a computational model of HVC embodying several central hypotheses: 1) sparse bursting is generated in bistable groups of recurrently connected robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA)-projecting (HVCRA) neurons; 2) inhibitory interneurons terminate bursts in the HVCRA groups; and 3) sparse sequences of bursts are generated by the propagation of waves of bursting activity along networks of HVCRA neurons. Our model of sparse bursting places HVC in the context of central pattern generators and cortical networks using inhibition, recurrent excitation, and bistability. Importantly, the unintuitive result that inhibitory interneurons can precisely terminate the bursts of HVCRA groups while showing relatively sustained activity throughout the song is made possible by a specific constraint on their connectivity. We use the model to make novel predictions that can be tested experimentally.},

  abstract      = {Gastric carcinoids are of increasing clinical concern because they may develop in hypergastrinemic states, especially with the increased chronic use of potent acid suppressants that can cause hypergastrinemia. However, gastric carcinoids are difficult to diagnose. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) has a high sensitivity and specificity for localizing carcinoids in other locations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether SRS could localize gastric carcinoids. METHODS: Two groups of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with hypergastrinemia, each having a different increased risk of developing gastric carcinoids, were studied. One hundred sixty-two consecutive patients with ZES were studied prospectively, with 39 having multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN-1) (high increased risk), and 123 not having MEN-1 (low increased risk). Patients were admitted to the hospital initially and then yearly, undergoing SRS with SPECT, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and Jumbo Cup biopsies of any gastric abnormalities, as well as random biopsies of the gastric body. Tumor localization studies were also performed. Both the results of the routine SRS interpretation and the results of a masked review, with particular attention to the stomach of high risk MEN-1 patients, were correlated with the gastric biopsy results. RESULTS: Gastric SRS localization was positive in 19 (12\%) of 162 patients. Sixteen patients had a gastric carcinoid, and 12 of these patients had SRS localization. The sensitivity of SRS in localizing a gastric carcinoid was 75\%, with a specificity of 95\%. Positive and negative predictive values were 63\% and 97\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: SRS is a noninvasive method that can identify patients with gastric carcinoids with a reasonable sensitivity and a high specificity. SRS should prove useful in the treatment of patients with hypergastrinemic states that have an increased incidence of gastric carcinoids. In patients with MEN-1, one must realize that localization in the upper abdomen on SRS may be caused by a gastric carcinoid and not a pancreatic endocrine tumor.},

What is presently unclear is whether this cortical area also plays a role in spontaneous recognition and discrimination of natural categories. Here, we explore this possibility by recording from neurons in the PFC while rhesus listen to species-specific vocalizations that vary in terms of their social function and acoustic morphology. We found that ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) activity, on average, did not differentiate between food calls that were associated with the same functional category, despite having different acoustic properties. In contrast, vPFC activity differentiated between food calls associated with different functional classes and specifically, information about the quality and motivational value of the food. These results suggest that the vPFC is involved in the categorization of socially meaningful signals, thereby both extending its previously conceived role in the acquisition of learned categories and showing the significance of using natural categorical distinctions in the study of neural mechanisms.},

We begin by encoding information about the basic structure of the natural world and continue to assimilate information about specific patterns with which we become familiar. The specificity of the learning suggests that all areas of the cerebral cortex are plastic and can represent various aspects of learned information. The neural substrate of perceptual learning relates to the nature of the neural code itself, including changes in cortical maps, in the temporal characteristics of neuronal responses, and in modulation of contextual influences. Top-down control of these representations suggests that learning involves an interaction between multiple cortical areas.},

  abstract      = {High-level sensory neurons encoding natural stimuli are not well described by linear models operating on the time-varying stimulus intensity. Here we show that firing rates of neurons in a secondary sensory forebrain area can be better modeled by linear functions of how surprising the stimulus is. We modeled auditory neurons in the caudal lateral mesopallium (CLM) of adult male zebra finches under urethane anesthesia with linear filters convolved not with stimulus intensity, but with stimulus surprise. Surprise was quantified as the logarithm of the probability of the stimulus given the local recent stimulus history and expectations based on conspecific song. Using our surprise method, the predictions of neural responses to conspecific song improved by 67\% relative to those obtained using stimulus intensity. Similar prediction improvements cannot be replicated by assuming CLM performs derivative detection. The explanatory power of surprise increased from the midbrain through the primary forebrain and to CLM. When the stimulus presented was a random synthetic ripple noise, CLM neurons (but not neurons in lower auditory areas) were best described as if they were expecting conspecific song, finding the inconsistencies between birdsong and noise surprising. In summary, spikes in CLM neurons indicate stimulus surprise more than they indicate stimulus intensity features. The concept of stimulus surprise may be useful for modeling neural responses in other higher-order sensory areas whose functions have been poorly understood.},

  abstract      = {1. Isolated, single-neuron extracellular potentials were recorded sequentially in area TE of the inferior temporal cortex (IT) of two macaque monkeys (n = 58 and n = 41 neurons). Data were obtained while the animals were performing a paired-associate task. The task utilized five stimuli and eight stimulus pairings (4 correct and 4 incorrect). Data were evaluated as average spike rate during experimental epochs of 100 or 400 ms. Single-unit and population characteristics were measured using a form of linear discriminant analysis and information theoretic measures. To evaluate the significance of covariance on population code measures, additional data consisting of simultaneous recordings from < or = 8 isolated neurons (n = 37) were obtained from a third macaque monkey that was passively viewing visual stimuli. 2. On average, 43\% of IT neurons were activated by any of the stimuli used (60\% if those inhibited also are included). Yet the neurons were rather unique in the relative magnitude of their responses to each stimulus in the test set. These results suggest that information may be represented in IT by the pattern of activity across neurons and that the representation is not sparsely coded. It is further suggested that the representation scheme may have similarities to DNA or computer codes wherein a coding element is not a local parametric descriptor. This is a departure from the V1 representation, which appears to be both local and parametric. It is also different from theories of IT representation that suggest a constructive basis set or ``alphabet''. From this view, determination of stimulus discrimination capacity in IT should be evaluated by measures of population activity patterns. 3. Evaluation of small groups of simultaneously recorded neurons obtained during a fixation task suggests that little information about visual stimuli is conveyed by covariance of activity in IT when a 100-ms time scale is used as in this study. This finding is consistent with a prior report, by Gochin et al., which used a 1-ms time scale and failed to find neural activity coherence or oscillations dependent on stimuli. 4. Population-stimulus-discrimination capacity measures were influenced by the number of neurons and to some extent the number and type of stimuli. 5. Information conveyed by individual neurons (mutual information) averaged 0.26 bits. The distribution of information values was unimodal and is therefore more consistent with a distributed than a local coding scheme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

This 'perceptual learning' is often specific to the stimuli presented during training, indicating that practice may alter the response characteristics of cortical sensory neurons. Although much is known about how learning modifies cortical circuits, it remains unclear how these changes relate to behaviour. Different theories assume that practice improves discrimination by enhancing the signal, diminishing internal noise or both. Here, to distinguish among these alternatives, we fashioned sets of faces and textures whose signal strength could be varied, and we trained observers to identify these patterns embedded in noise. Performance increased by up to 400\% across several sessions over several days. Comparisons of human performance to that of an ideal discriminator showed that learning increased the efficiency with which observers encoded task-relevant information. Observer response consistency, measured by a double-pass technique in which identical stimuli are shown twice in each experimental session, did not change during training, showing that learning had no effect on internal noise. These results indicate that perceptual learning may enhance signal strength, and provide important constraints for theories of learning.},

The brain mechanisms that underpin the syndrome have not been defined: a better understanding of these mechanisms would inform our understanding of both the organisation of the human semantic system and its vulnerability to neurodegenerative disease. In this fMRI study, we investigated brain correlates of sensory object processing in nine patients with SD compared with healthy control subjects, using the paradigm of nonverbal sound. Compared with healthy controls, patients with SD showed differential activation of cortical areas surrounding the superior temporal sulcus, both for perceptual processing of spectrotemporally complex but meaningless sounds and for semantic processing of environmental sound category (animal sounds versus tool sounds). Our findings suggest that defective processing of sound objects in SD spans pre-semantic perceptual processing and semantic category formation. This disease model illustrates that antero-lateral temporal cortical mechanisms are critical for representing and differentiating sound categories. The breakdown of these mechanisms constitutes a network-level functional signature of this neurodegenerative disease.},

We have used data produced from a model of the spatiotemporal receptive fields of parvocellular and magnocellular lateral geniculate neurons to study the performance of these methods as a function of the number of trials used. Both procedures yield accurate results for one-dimensional neuronal codes. They can also be used to produce a reasonable estimate of the extra information in a three-dimensional code, in this instance, within 0.05-0.1 bit of the asymptotically calculated value--about 10\% of the total transmitted information. We believe that this performance is much more accurate than previous procedures.},

  abstract      = {The minimal change in a stimulus property that is detectable by neurons has been often quantified using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, but recent studies introduced the use of the related Fisher information (FI). Whereas ROC analysis and FI quantify the information available for discriminating between two stimuli, global aspects of the information carried by a neuron are quantified by the mutual information (MI) between stimuli and responses. FI and MI have been shown to be related to each other when FI is large. Here the responses of neurons recorded in the inferior colliculus of anesthetized guinea pigs in response to ensembles of sounds differing in their interaural time differences (ITDs) or binaural correlation (BC) were analyzed. Although the FI is not uniformly large, there are strong relationships between MI and FI. Information-theoretic measures are used to demonstrate the importance of the non-Poisson statistics of these responses. These neurons may reflect the maximization of the MI between stimuli and responses under constraints on the coded stimulus range and the range of firing rates. Remarkably, whereas the maximization of MI, in conjunction with the non-Poisson statistics of the spike trains, is enough to create neurons whose ITD discrimination capabilities are close to the behavioral limits, the same rule does not achieve single-neuron BC discrimination that is as close to behavioral performance.},

Transfer entropy is also able to eliminate some effects of common history in spike trains and obtains results that are different from cross-correlation. The basic transfer entropy properties are illustrated with simulations. The information transfer through a network of 16 simultaneous multiunit recordings in cat's auditory cortex was examined for a large number of acoustic stimulus types. Application of the transfer entropy to a large database of multiple single-unit activity in cat's primary auditory cortex revealed that most windows of temporal integration found during spontaneous activity range between 2 and 15 ms. The normalized transfer entropy shows similarities and differences with the strength of cross-correlation; these form the basis for revisiting the neural assembly concept.},

  abstract      = {Drosophila is an important model organism for investigating neural development, neural morphology, neurophysiology, and neural correlates of behaviors. However, almost nothing is known about how electrical signals propagate in Drosophila neurons. Here, we address these issues in antennal lobe projection neurons, one of the most well studied classes of Drosophila neurons. We use morphological and electrophysiological data to deduce the passive membrane properties of these neurons and to build a compartmental model of their electrotonic structure. We find that these neurons are electrotonically extensive and that a somatic recording electrode can only imperfectly control the voltage in the rest of the cell. Simulations predict that action potentials initiate at a location distant from the soma, in the proximal portion of the axon. Simulated synaptic input to a single dendritic branch propagates poorly to the rest of the cell and cannot match the size of real unitary synaptic events, but we can obtain a good fit to data when we model unitary input synapses as dozens of release sites distributed across many dendritic branches. We also show that the true resting potential of these neurons is more hyperpolarized than previously thought, attributable to the experimental error introduced by the electrode seal conductance. A leak sodium conductance also contributes to the resting potential. Together, these findings have fundamental implications for how these neurons integrate their synaptic inputs. Our results also have important consequences for the design and interpretation of experiments aimed at understanding Drosophila neurons and neural circuits.},

The principal auditory forebrain area in songbirds consists of the tonotopically organized field L complex, which, by its location in the auditory processing stream, can be compared with the auditory cortex of mammals. We also recorded from a secondary auditory area, cHV. Field L and cHV are auditory processing stages that are presynaptic to the specialized song system nuclei where auditory neurons show an extremely selective response for the bird's own song, but weak response to almost any other sounds, including conspecific songs. In our study, we found that neurons in field L and cHV had stronger responses to conspecific song than to synthetic sounds that were designed to match the lower order acoustical properties of song, such as their overall power spectra and AM spectra. Such preferential responses to natural sounds cannot be explained by linear frequency tuning or simple nonlinear intensity tuning and requires linear or nonlinear spectro-temporal neuronal transfer functions tuned to the acoustical properties of song. The selectivity for conspecific songs in field L and cHV might reflect an intermediate auditory processing stage for vocalizations that then contributes to the generation of the very specific selectivity for the bird's own song seen in the postsynaptic song system.},

Recently, we have shown that neurons in the cat visual cortex have oscillatory responses in the range 40-60 Hz (refs 1, 2) which occur in synchrony for cells in a functional column and are tightly correlated with a local oscillatory field potential. This led us to hypothesize that the synchronization of oscillatory responses of spatially distributed, feature selective cells might be a way to establish relations between features in different parts of the visual field. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that neurons in spatially separate columns can synchronize their oscillatory responses. The synchronization has, on average, no phase difference, depends on the spatial separation and the orientation preference of the cells and is influenced by global stimulus properties.},

Here we report a series of behavioural, neuroimaging and electrophysiological experiments that investigate and define the ability to orient attention in the temporal domain. These studies reveal that we are able to orient attention selectively to different time intervals, enhancing behavioural performance. These effects are mediated by a left-hemisphere dominant frontal-parietal system, which partially overlaps with the networks involved in spatial orienting. The optimisation of behaviour by temporal orienting appears to be achieved via motor-related mechanisms, in contrast to the typical perceptual enhancements produced by spatial attention. From a more general perspective, these findings illustrate the flexibility of attentional functions in the human brain.},

  abstract      = {Two studies compared the modulatory effects of orienting attention to spatial locations versus temporal intervals using event-related potentials (ERPs). In both experiments subjects performed attentional orienting tasks, which used identical stimuli in both spatial and temporal orienting conditions. The first experiment (N=16) used bilateral peripheral targets (7.5 degrees eccentricity) at two different time intervals (600, 1200 ms after cue onset). During spatial orienting a symbolic central cue predicted (75\% probability) the spatial location (left, right) of the relevant target. No information was given about the probable target interval (short, long). In temporal orienting the cue predicted the target interval but not its location. Valid cueing produced significantly shorter reaction times in both the spatial and temporal orienting conditions. ERPs to identical, non-target stimulus arrays were analysed, to isolate endogenous attentional mechanisms. Spatial and temporal attention had distinct modulatory effects upon stimulus processing. Focused spatial attention affected the amplitude of early visual components. Modulation by temporal attention started later, and mainly affected potentials linked to decisions and responses. The second experiment (N=12) used unilateral target stimuli, and equated the probability of stimulus occurrence at short and long time intervals and at left or right of fixation. The results confirmed the distinct pattern of modulation of stimulus processing by spatial and temporal orienting. The optimisation of behaviour by attention can thus be achieved as a consequence of distinct modulatory processes, illustrating the flexibility of attentional functions in the human brain.},

A key factor that will promote such understanding in the future will be increasing dialogue between workers using electrophysiological recording methods to assess the response properties of single neurons and those using imaging techniques to map regional organization. In the future, further insights will be obtained by efforts to test hypotheses developed on the basis of one approach by the use of the other. Imaging can tell the neurophysiologists where to look, and work on single neurons can constrain network models based on imaging.

This question is approached for working memory, a cognitive entity that is equally organized in birds and mammals. The critical forebrain structure for working memory is the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) in birds and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mammals. Although both structures share a large number of neural architectural features, they are probably not homologous but represent a remarkable case of convergent evolution. In reviewing the neuronal mechanisms for working memory in birds and mammals it becomes apparent that the similarities of NCL and PFC extend from the neuronal activation patterns during memory tasks down to the biophysical mechanisms of synaptic currents. Both in mammals and birds, dopamine acts via D1-receptors to tune preactivated neurons into sustained high-frequency patterns with which goal states can be held over time until an appropriate response can be generated. The degrees of freedom to create different neural architectures to solve the problem of 'stimulus maintenance' seem to be very small.},

  abstract      = {Our perception of the environment relies on the capacity of neural networks to adapt rapidly to changes in incoming stimuli. It is increasingly being realized that the neural code is adaptive, that is, sensory neurons change their responses and selectivity in a dynamic manner to match the changes in input stimuli. Understanding how rapid exposure, or adaptation, to a stimulus of fixed structure changes information processing by cortical networks is essential for understanding the relationship between sensory coding and behaviour. Physiological investigations of adaptation have contributed greatly to our understanding of how individual sensory neurons change their responses to influence stimulus coding, yet whether and how adaptation affects information coding in neural populations is unknown. Here we examine how brief adaptation (on the timescale of visual fixation) influences the structure of interneuronal correlations and the accuracy of population coding in the macaque (Macaca mulatta) primary visual cortex (V1). We find that brief adaptation to a stimulus of fixed structure reorganizes the distribution of correlations across the entire network by selectively reducing their mean and variability. The post-adaptation changes in neuronal correlations are associated with specific, stimulus-dependent changes in the efficiency of the population code, and are consistent with changes in perceptual performance after adaptation. Our results have implications beyond the predictions of current theories of sensory coding, suggesting that brief adaptation improves the accuracy of population coding to optimize neuronal performance during natural viewing.},

In songbirds, one prominent site of pre-motor activity is the forebrain robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which generates stereotyped sequences of spike bursts during song and recapitulates these sequences during sleep. We show that the stereotyped sequences in RA are driven from nucleus HVC (high vocal centre), the principal pre-motor input to RA. Recordings of identified HVC neurons in sleeping and singing birds show that individual HVC neurons projecting onto RA neurons produce bursts sparsely, at a single, precise time during the RA sequence. These HVC neurons burst sequentially with respect to one another. We suggest that at each time in the RA sequence, the ensemble of active RA neurons is driven by a subpopulation of RA-projecting HVC neurons that is active only at that time. As a population, these HVC neurons may form an explicit representation of time in the sequence. Such a sparse representation, a temporal analogue of the 'grandmother cell' concept for object recognition, eliminates the problem of temporal interference during sequence generation and learning attributed to more distributed representations.},

Sensory activation differences may therefore be masked by the effect of attention. The present study measured activation induced by static and modulated tones, while controlling attention by using target-discrimination and passive listening tasks. The factorial design enabled us to determine whether the stimulus-induced activation in auditory cortex was independent of the information-processing demands of the task. Contrasted against a silent baseline, listening to the tones induced widespread activation in the temporal cortex, including Heschl's gyrus (HG), planum temporale, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and superior temporal sulcus. No additional auditory areas were recruited in the response to modulated tones compared to static tones, but there was an increase in the response in the STG, anterior to HG. Relative to passive listening, the active task increased the response in the STG, posterior to HG. The active task also recruited regions in the frontal and parietal cortex and subcortical areas. These findings indicate that preferential responses to the changing spectro-temporal properties of the stimuli and to the target-discrimination task involve distinct, non-overlapping areas of the secondary auditory cortex. Thus, in the present study, differences in sensory activation were not masked by the effects of attention.},

The dynamic evolution of assembly sequences, which are steered but not deterministically controlled by sensory input, is the proposed substrate of psychological processes beyond simple stimulus-response associations. Accordingly, spike trains show a temporal structure that is stimulus-dependent and more variable than would be predicted by strict sensory control. We propose four signatures of assembly organization that can be experimentally tested. We argue that many observations that have been interpreted as evidence for temporal coding might instead reflect an underlying assembly structure.},

  abstract      = {Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision. A fundamental issue is whether, and how, this capability is used in information processing. According to the 'cell assembly' hypothesis, transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly, neuron populations should be arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common modulation by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase modulation. The time window in which spike times are best predicted from simultaneous peer activity is 10-30 ms, suggesting that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal neurons, the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation and the time window for synaptic plasticity, we propose that cooperative activity at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage in cortical circuits.},

  abstract      = {Resampling methods are popular tools for exploring the statistical structure of neural spike trains. In many applications, it is desirable to have resamples that preserve certain non-Poisson properties, like refractory periods and bursting, and that are also robust to trial-to-trial variability. Pattern jitter is a resampling technique that accomplishes this by preserving the recent spiking history of all spikes and constraining resampled spikes to remain close to their original positions. The resampled spike times are maximally random up to these constraints. Dynamic programming is used to create an efficient resampling algorithm.},

  abstract      = {There is both extensive species-specificity and critical experience-dependence in the recognition of own species songs in many songbird species. For example, female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata raised by their parents show behavioral preferences for the songs of the father over unfamiliar conspecific males and for unfamiliar songs of conspecifics over heterospecifics. Behavioral discrimination between different species' songs is also displayed by females raised without exposure to any male songs but it is diminished in females raised by heterospecific foster parents. We tested whether neural responses in the female auditory forebrain paralleled each of these known behavioral patterns in song-class discrimination. We analyzed spike rates, above background levels, recorded from single units in the L2a subregion of the field L complex of female zebra finches. In subjects raised by genetic parents, spike rates were similar to songs of fathers and unfamiliar male zebra finches, and higher to unfamiliar conspecific over unfamiliar heterospecific songs. In females raised in isolation from male songs, we also found higher spike rates to unfamiliar conspecific over heterospecific songs. In females raised by heterospecific foster parents, spike rates were similar in response to songs of the foster father and unfamiliar males of the foster species, similar between unfamiliar songs of conspecifics and the heterospecific foster species, and higher to unfamiliar songs of the foster species over a third finch species. Thus, in parallel to the experience-dependence of females' behaviors in response to different male song classes, differences in social experiences can also alter neural response patterns to male song classes in the auditory forebrain of female zebra finches.},

Here we analyzed binding-site densities of glutamatergic AMPA, NMDA and kainate receptors, GABAergic GABA(A), muscarinic M(1), M(2) and nicotinic (nACh) receptors, noradrenergic alpha(1) and alpha(2), serotonergic 5-HT(1A) and dopaminergic D(1)-like receptors using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. We compared the receptor architecture of the pigeons' nidopallial structures, in particular the NCL, with cortical areas Fr2 and Cg1 in rats and prefrontal area BA10 in humans. Our results confirmed that the relative ratios of multiple receptor densities across different nidopallial structures (their ``receptor fingerprints'') were very similar in shape; however, the absolute binding densities (the ``size'' of the fingerprints) differed significantly. This finding enables a delineation of the avian NCL from surrounding structures and a further parcellation into a medial and a lateral part as revealed by differences in densities of nACh, M(2), kainate, and 5-HT(1A) receptors. Comparisons of the NCL with the rat and human frontal structures showed differences in the receptor distribution, particularly of the glutamate receptors, but also revealed highly conserved features like the identical densities of GABA(A), M(2), nACh and D(1)-like receptors. Assuming a convergent evolution of avian and mammalian prefrontal areas, our results support the hypothesis that specific neurochemical traits provide the molecular background for higher order processes such as executive functions. The differences in glutamate receptor distributions may reflect species-specific adaptations.},

  abstract      = {The functional neuroanatomy of speech perception has been difficult to characterize. Part of the difficulty, we suggest, stems from the fact that the neural systems supporting 'speech perception' vary as a function of the task. Specifically, the set of cognitive and neural systems involved in performing traditional laboratory speech perception tasks, such as syllable discrimination or identification, only partially overlap those involved in speech perception as it occurs during natural language comprehension. In this review, we argue that cortical fields in the posterior-superior temporal lobe, bilaterally, constitute the primary substrate for constructing sound-based representations of speech, and that these sound-based representations interface with different supramodal systems in a task-dependent manner. Tasks that require access to the mental lexicon (i.e. accessing meaning-based representations) rely on auditory-to-meaning interface systems in the cortex in the vicinity of the left temporal-parietal-occipital junction. Tasks that require explicit access to speech segments rely on auditory-motor interface systems in the left frontal and parietal lobes. This auditory-motor interface system also appears to be recruited in phonological working memory.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine auditory attention to natural speech under such high processing-load conditions. Participants attended to a single talker in a group of 3, identified by the target talker's pitch or spatial location. A catch-trial design allowed us to distinguish activity due to top-down control of attention versus attentional selection of bottom-up information in both the spatial and spectral (pitch) feature domains. For attentional control, we found a left-dominant fronto-parietal network with a bias toward spatial processing in dorsal precentral sulcus and superior parietal lobule, and a bias toward pitch in inferior frontal gyrus. During selection of the talker, attention modulated activity in left intraparietal sulcus when using talker location and in bilateral but right-dominant superior temporal sulcus when using talker pitch. We argue that these networks represent the sources and targets of selective attention in rich auditory environments.},

  abstract      = {MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) relies on the detection of cortical current flow by measurement of the associated magnetic field outside the head. The amplitude of this magnetic field depends strongly on the depth of the electrical brain activity. Additionally, radially orientated sources are magnetically silent in a concentrically homogeneous volume conductor, giving rise to the anecdotal assumptions that MEG is insensitive to both deep and gyral sources. Utilising cortical surfaces extracted from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) of two adult brains we constructed all possible single source elements and examined the proportion of active neocortex that is actually detectable with a whole-head MEG system. We identified those electrically active regions to which MEG is maximally sensitive by analytically computing the probability of detecting a source within a specified confidence volume. Our findings show that source depth, and not orientation, is the main factor that compromises the sensitivity of MEG to activity in the adult human cortex. There are thin strips (approximately 2 mm wide) of poor resolvability at the crests of gyri; however, these strips account for only a relatively small proportion of the cortical area and are abutted by elements with nominal tangential component yet high resolvability due to their proximity to the sensor array. Finally, we varied the extent of the patches of cortical activity, showing that small patches have a small net-current moment and are therefore less visible whereas large patches have a strong net-current moment, are generally more visible to the MEG system, yet are less appropriately modelled as single dipoles.},

Processing along the feedforward hierarchy of areas, leading to increasingly complex representations, is automatic and implicit, while conscious perception begins at the hierarchy's top, gradually returning downward as needed. Thus, our initial conscious percept--vision at a glance--matches a high-level, generalized, categorical scene interpretation, identifying ``forest before trees.'' For later vision with scrutiny, reverse hierarchy routines focus attention to specific, active, low-level units, incorporating into conscious perception detailed information available there. Reverse Hierarchy Theory dissociates between early explicit perception and implicit low-level vision, explaining a variety of phenomena. Feature search ``pop-out'' is attributed to high areas, where large receptive fields underlie spread attention detecting categorical differences. Search for conjunctions or fine discriminations depends on reentry to low-level specific receptive fields using serial focused attention, consistent with recently reported primary visual cortex effects.},

  abstract      = {People are highly skilled at attending to one speaker in the presence of competitors, but the neural mechanisms supporting this remain unclear. Recent studies have argued that the auditory system enhances the gain of a speech stream relative to competitors by entraining (or ``phase-locking'') to the rhythmic structure in its acoustic envelope, thus ensuring that syllables arrive during periods of high neuronal excitability. We hypothesized that such a mechanism could also suppress a competing speech stream by ensuring that syllables arrive during periods of low neuronal excitability. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG recorded from human adults while they attended to one of two competing, naturalistic speech streams. By calculating the cross-correlation between the EEG channels and the speech envelopes, we found evidence of entrainment to the attended speech's acoustic envelope as well as weaker yet significant entrainment to the unattended speech's envelope. An independent component analysis (ICA) decomposition of the data revealed sources in the posterior temporal cortices that displayed robust correlations to both the attended and unattended envelopes. Critically, in these components the signs of the correlations when attended were opposite those when unattended, consistent with the hypothesized entrainment-based suppressive mechanism.},

Yet animals encounter many environments with visual statistics different from the average scene. Here we show that when this happens, the retina adjusts its processing dynamically. The spatio-temporal receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells change after a few seconds in a new environment. The changes are adaptive, in that the new receptive field improves predictive coding under the new image statistics.

  abstract      = {Since the earliest studies of auditory cortex, it has been clear that an animal's behavioral or attentional state can play a crucial role in shaping the response characteristics of single neurons. Much of what has been learned about attention has been made using human and animal models, but little is known about the cellular and synaptic mechanisms by which attentional modulation of neuronal responses occurs. The use of rodent experimental models allows us to exploit the full armamentarium of modern cellular and molecular neuroscience techniques. Here we present our program for studying auditory attention, specifically for development of rodent models of attention and finding the neural correlates of attention.},

  abstract      = {We examined the neural encoding of synthetic and natural sounds by single neurons in the auditory system of male zebra finches by estimating the mutual information in the time-varying mean firing rate of the neuronal response. Using a novel parametric method for estimating mutual information with limited data, we tested the hypothesis that song and song-like synthetic sounds would be preferentially encoded relative to other complex, but non-song-like synthetic sounds. To test this hypothesis, we designed two synthetic stimuli: synthetic songs that matched the power of spectral-temporal modulations but lacked the modulation phase structure of zebra finch song and noise with uniform band-limited spectral-temporal modulations. By defining neural selectivity as relative mutual information, we found that the auditory system of songbirds showed selectivity for song-like sounds. This selectivity increased in a hierarchical manner along ascending processing stages in the auditory system. Midbrain neurons responded with highest information rates and efficiency to synthetic songs and thus were selective for the spectral-temporal modulations of song. Primary forebrain neurons showed increased information to zebra finch song and synthetic song equally over noise stimuli. Secondary forebrain neurons responded with the highest information to zebra finch song relative to other stimuli and thus were selective for its specific modulation phase relationships. We also assessed the relative contribution of three response properties to this selectivity: (1) spiking reliability, (2) rate distribution entropy, and (3) bandwidth. We found that rate distribution and bandwidth but not reliability were responsible for the higher average information rates found for song-like sounds.},

  abstract      = {'Spontaneous' and visually evoked action potentials were recorded from single neurons in cytoarchitectonic area 17 (striate cortex, area V1) of anaesthetized and immobilized cats, prior to, during and after brief reversible inactivation of the ipsilateral postero-temporal visual (PTV) cortex (presumed homologue of primate inferotemporal cortex). Inactivation of PTV cortex resulted: 1) in significant changes in the response magnitude (mostly a reduction) to optimal and/or sub-optimal visual stimuli in over 55\% of area 17 cells and 2) significant changes (usually a reduction) in the 'spontaneous' (background) activity of about two-thirds of the cells in which inactivation of PTV cortex significantly affected the magnitude of responses to optimal stimuli. In over 85\% of the significantly affected area 17 cells, rewarming PTV cortex to normal temperature (36 degrees C) resulted in the recovery of both the magnitude of responses and the background activity to levels not significantly different from pre-inactivation levels. Irrespective of the significance of changes in the magnitude of responses, in a substantial proportion of area 17 cells, inactivation of PTV cortex resulted in changes in some receptive field characteristics. Thus, there were substantial (20\% or more) changes in orientation tuning widths (in over a quarter of the sample) and/or direction selectivity indices (in about a third of the sample). Thus, the feedback signals originating from PTV cortex, like signals originating from some other 'higher-order' visual cortical areas exert a clear modulatory influence on the responsiveness, background activity and some receptive field properties of neurons in the ipsilateral area 17.},

  abstract      = {A single visual stimulus activates neurons in many different cortical areas. A major challenge in cortical physiology is to understand how the neural activity in these numerous active zones leads to a unified percept of the visual scene. The anatomical basis for these interactions is the dense network of connections that link the visual areas. Within this network, feedforward connections transmit signals from lower-order areas such as V1 or V2 to higher-order areas. In addition, there is a dense web of feedback connections which, despite their anatomical prominence, remain functionally mysterious. Here we show, using reversible inactivation of a higher-order area (monkey area V5/MT), that feedback connections serve to amplify and focus activity of neurons in lower-order areas, and that they are important in the differentiation of figure from ground, particularly in the case of stimuli of low visibility. More specifically, we show that feedback connections facilitate responses to objects moving within the classical receptive field; enhance suppression evoked by background stimuli in the surrounding region; and have the strongest effects for stimuli of low salience.},

Here, we review evidence suggesting that some of these functions may be supported by shared underlying neuronal mechanisms. Specifically, we present, based on an integrative review of the literature, a hypothetical model wherein short-term plasticity, in the form of transient center-excitatory and surround-inhibitory modulations, constitutes a generic processing principle that supports sensory memory, short-term memory, involuntary attention, selective attention, and perceptual learning. In our model, the size and complexity of receptive fields/level of abstraction of neural representations, as well as the length of temporal receptive windows, increases as one steps up the cortical hierarchy. Consequently, the type of input (bottom-up vs. top down) and the level of cortical hierarchy that the inputs target, determine whether short-term plasticity supports purely sensory vs. semantic short-term memory or attentional functions. Furthermore, we suggest that rather than discrete memory systems, there are continuums of memory representations from short-lived sensory ones to more abstract longer-duration representations, such as those tapped by behavioral studies of short-term memory.},

Valid expectations improved both the speed and the accuracy of the subjects' performance, indicating not only improved motor preparedness but also enhanced perception. Single-neuron recordings in primary auditory cortex showed enhanced representation of sounds during periods of heightened expectation. Furthermore, we found that activity in auditory cortex was causally linked to the performance of the task and that changes in the neuronal representation of sounds predicted performance on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results indicate that changes in neuronal representation as early as primary sensory cortex mediate the perceptual advantage conferred by temporal expectation.},

Brain pathways for vocal learning have been studied in the three bird groups and in humans. Here I present a hypothesis on the relationships and evolution of brain pathways for vocal learning among birds and humans. The three vocal learning bird groups each appear to have seven similar but not identical cerebral vocal nuclei distributed into two vocal pathways, one posterior and one anterior. Humans also appear to have a posterior vocal pathway, which includes projections from the face motor cortex to brainstem vocal lower motor neurons, and an anterior vocal pathway, which includes a strip of premotor cortex, the anterior basal ganglia, and the anterior thalamus. These vocal pathways are not found in vocal non-learning birds or mammals, but are similar to brain pathways used for other types of learning. Thus, I argue that if vocal learning evolved independently among birds and humans, then it did so under strong genetic constraints of a pre-existing basic neural network of the vertebrate brain.},

  abstract      = {The spectrum and coherency are useful quantities for characterizing the temporal correlations and functional relations within and between point processes. This article begins with a review of these quantities, their interpretation, and how they may be estimated. A discussion of how to assess the statistical significance of features in these measures is included. In addition, new work is presented that builds on the framework established in the review section. This work investigates how the estimates and their error bars are modified by finite sample sizes. Finite sample corrections are derived based on a doubly stochastic inhomogeneous Poisson process model in which the rate functions are drawn from a low-variance gaussian process. It is found that in contrast to continuous processes, the variance of the estimators cannot be reduced by smoothing beyond a scale set by the number of point events in the interval. Alternatively, the degrees of freedom of the estimators can be thought of as bounded from above by the expected number of point events in the interval. Further new work describing and illustrating a method for detecting the presence of a line in a point process spectrum is also presented, corresponding to the detection of a periodic modulation of the underlying rate. This work demonstrates that a known statistical test, applicable to continuous processes, applies with little modification to point process spectra and is of utility in studying a point process driven by a continuous stimulus. Although the material discussed is of general applicability to point processes, attention will be confined to sequences of neuronal action potentials (spike trains), the motivation for this work.},

  abstract      = {The diversity of cultured planktonic bacteria was analyzed. Bacterial strains were isolated from a eutrophic lake (Zwischenahner Meer, Niedersachsen, Germany) at three different sampling dates (October 1997, April and May 1998). Phylogenetic diversity was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR revealed a high genomic diversity within the strain collections, which exceeded the diversity of the 16S rRNA gene sequences considerably. The composition of each of the three strain collections was unique since strains isolated at different dates always exhibited different ERIC-PCR fingerprints. Growth tests with 59 different carbon substrates demonstrated that even strains with identical ERIC-PCR fingerprints, isolated on one sampling date, differed in their physiology. The culturable fraction investigated in the present study constituted a relatively small fraction (</=15\%) of the whole bacterioplankton assemblage. Nevertheless, the high physiological diversity in this fraction already indicates that a multitude of different ecological niches must exist in the planktonic environment. The majority of strains isolated in April prior to the decay of the phytoplankton bloom were members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group. One month later, not a single strain of this group could be isolated. When a group-specific PCR-DGGE technique was employed, rapid shifts in the diversity of non-cultured Cytophaga-Flavobacteria also became evident. Based on the rapid shifts in the composition of cultivated as well as some non-cultivated bacteria, the ecological niches in the planktonic habitat must undergo rapid temporal changes.},

  abstract      = {Many learned behaviors are thought to require the activity of high-level neurons that represent categories of complex signals, such as familiar faces or native speech sounds. How these complex, experience-dependent neural responses emerge within the brain's circuitry is not well understood. The caudomedial mesopallium (CMM), a secondary auditory region in the songbird brain, contains neurons that respond to specific combinations of song components and respond preferentially to the songs that birds have learned to recognize. Here, we examine the transformation of these learned responses across a broader forebrain circuit that includes the caudolateral mesopallium (CLM), an auditory region that provides input to CMM. We recorded extracellular single-unit activity in CLM and CMM in European starlings trained to recognize sets of conspecific songs and compared multiple encoding properties of neurons between these regions. We find that the responses of CMM neurons are more selective between song components, convey more information about song components, and are more variable over repeated components than the responses of CLM neurons. While learning enhances neural encoding of song components in both regions, CMM neurons encode more information about the learned categories associated with songs than do CLM neurons. Collectively, these data suggest that CLM and CMM are part of a functional sensory hierarchy that is modified by learning to yield representations of natural vocal signals that are increasingly informative with respect to behavior.},

  abstract      = {Reorganization of the frequency map in the central auditory system is based on shifts in the best frequencies (BFs; hereafter, BF shifts), together with the frequency-response curves, of auditory neurons. In the big brown bat, conditioning with acoustic stimulation followed by electric leg-stimulation causes BF shifts of collicular and cortical neurons. The collicular BF shift develops quickly and is short term, whereas the cortical BF shift develops slowly and is long term. The acetycholine level in the auditory cortex must be high during conditioning to develop these BF shifts. We studied the effect of atropine (an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) applied to the auditory cortex on the development of the long-term cortical BF shift in the awake bat caused by a 30-min conditioning session. We found 1) the cortical BF shift starts to develop approximately 15 min after the onset of the conditioning, gradually increases over 60 min, and reaches a plateau, 2) the cortical BF shift changes from short to long term approximately 45 min after the onset of the conditioning, 3) the cortical BF shift can plateau at different frequencies between the BF of a given neuron in the control condition and the frequency of the conditioning tone, 4) the maximum BF shift is determined approximately 70 min after the onset of the conditioning, and 5) acetylcholine plays an important role in the development of the cortical BF shift. Its role ends approximately 180 min after the onset of the conditioning.},

We apply our new theory of information processing to determine the fidelity limits of simple population structures to encode stimulus features. We focus on noncooperative populations, which have no lateral connections. We show that they always exhibit positively correlated responses and that as population size increases, they perfectly represent the information conveyed by their inputs regardless of the individual neuron's coding scheme. Cooperative populations, which do have lateral connections, can, depending on the nature of the connections, perform better or worse than their noncooperative counterparts. We further show that common notions of synergy fail to capture the level of cooperation and to reflect the information processing properties of populations.},

  abstract      = {The magnitude of correlations between stimulus-driven responses of pairs of neurons can itself be stimulus dependent. We examine how this dependence affects the information carried by neural populations about the stimuli that drive them. Stimulus-dependent changes in correlations can both carry information directly and modulate the information separately carried by the firing rates and variances. We use Fisher information to quantify these effects and show that, although stimulus-dependent correlations often carry little information directly, their modulatory effects on the overall information can be large. In particular, if the stimulus dependence is such that correlations increase with stimulus-induced firing rates, this can significantly enhance the information of the population when the structure of correlations is determined solely by the stimulus. However, in the presence of additional strong spatial decay of correlations, such stimulus dependence may have a negative impact. Opposite relationships hold when correlations decrease with firing rates.},

Although various methods exist for treating multi-electrode datasets quantitatively there is a particularly prominent lack of techniques that enable a quick visual exploration of such datasets. Here, by using Kohonen self-organizing maps, we propose a simple technique that allows for the representation of multiple spike-trains through a sequence of color coded population activity vectors. When multiple color sequences are grouped according to a certain criterion, e.g. by stimulation condition or recording time, one can inspect an entire dataset visually and extract quickly information about the identity, stimulus-locking and temporal distribution of multi-neuron activity patterns. Color sequences can be computed on various timescales revealing different aspects of the temporal dynamics and can emphasize high-order correlation patterns that are not detectable with pairwise techniques. Furthermore, this technique is useful for determining the stability of neuronal responses during a recording session. Due to its simplicity and reliance on perceptual grouping, the method is useful for both quick online visualization of incoming data and for more detailed post-hoc analyses.},

  abstract      = {Current dimensionality-reduction methods can identify relevant subspaces for neural computations but do not favor one basis over the other within the relevant subspace. Finding the appropriate basis can simplify the description of the nonlinear computation with respect to the relevant variables, making it easier to elucidate the underlying neural computation and make hypotheses about the neural circuitry, giving rise to the observed responses. Part of the problem is that although some of the dimensionality reduction methods can identify many of the relevant dimensions, it is usually difficult to map out or interpret the nonlinear transformation with respect to more than a few relevant dimensions simultaneously without some simplifying assumptions. While recent approaches make it possible to create predictive models based on many relevant dimensions simultaneously, there still remains the need to relate such predictive models to the mechanistic descriptions of the operation of underlying neural circuitry. Here we demonstrate that transforming to a basis within the relevant subspace where the neural computation is best described by a given nonlinear function often makes it easier to interpret the computation and describe it with a small number of parameters. We refer to the corresponding basis as the functional basis, and illustrate the utility of such transformation in the context of logical OR and logical AND functions. We show that although dimensionality-reduction methods such as spike-triggered covariance are able to find a relevant subspace, they often produce dimensions that are difficult to interpret and do not correspond to a functional basis. The functional features can be found using a maximum likelihood approach. The results are illustrated using simulated neurons and recordings from retinal ganglion cells. The resulting features are uniquely defined and nonorthogonal, and they make it easier to relate computational and mechanistic models to each other.},

At subcortical levels, the structural components of the auditory system of monkeys resemble those of nonprimates, but the organization at cortical levels is different. In monkeys, the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate complex projects in parallel to a core of three primary-like auditory areas, AI, R, and RT, constituting the first stage of cortical processing. These areas interconnect and project to the homotopic and other locations in the opposite cerebral hemisphere and to a surrounding array of eight proposed belt areas as a second stage of cortical processing. The belt areas in turn project in overlapping patterns to a lateral parabelt region with at least rostral and caudal subdivisions as a third stage of cortical processing. The divisions of the parabelt distribute to adjoining auditory and multimodal regions of the temporal lobe and to four functionally distinct regions of the frontal lobe. Histochemically, chimpanzees and humans have an auditory core that closely resembles that of monkeys. The challenge for future researchers is to understand how this complex system in monkeys analyzes and utilizes auditory information.},

  abstract      = {Piriform cortical circuits are hypothesized to form perceptions from responses to specific odorant features, but the anterior piriform cortex (aPCX) and posterior piriform cortex (pPCX) differ markedly in their anatomical organization, differences that could lead to distinct roles in odor encoding. Here, we tested whether experience with a complex odorant mixture would modify encoding of the mixture and its components in aPCX and pPCX. Rats were exposed to an odorant mixture and its components in a go/no-go rewarded odor discrimination task. After reaching behavioral performance criterion, single-unit recordings were made from the aPCX and pPCX in these rats and in odor-naive, control, urethane-anesthetized rats. After odor experience, aPCX neurons were more narrowly tuned to the test odorants, and there was a decorrelation in aPCX population responses to the mixture and its components, suggesting a more distinct encoding of the familiar mixture from its components. In contrast, pPCX neurons were more broadly tuned to the familiar odorants, and pPCX population responses to the mixture and its components became more highly correlated, suggesting a pPCX encoding of similarity between familiar stimuli. The results suggest aPCX and pPCX play different roles in the processing of familiar odors and are consistent with an experience-dependent encoding (perceptual learning) of synthetic odorant identity in aPCX and an experience-dependent encoding of odor similarity or odor quality in pPCX.},

Spike count variability was lower than that of a Poisson process at all three stages but increased at each stage. Absolute and relative refractory periods largely accounted for the reliability at all three stages. Our results show that cortical responses can be more reliable than previously thought. The differences in reliability in retina, LGN, and cortex can be explained by (1) decreasing firing rates and (2) decreasing absolute and relative refractory periods.},

Elucidating the underlying mechanisms at the cellular and synaptic levels is an essential step in understanding neural plasticity in the mature animal. Although developmental and adult plasticity share many common features, notable differences may be attributed to developmental cortical changes at multiple levels. These range from shifts in the molecular profiles of cortical neurons to changes in the spatiotemporal dynamics of network activity. In this review, we will discuss recent progress and remaining challenges in understanding adult visual plasticity, focusing on the primary visual cortex.},

Particularly when experiments involve dynamics of neuronal response, scientific inference can become subtle and some statistical methods may make much more efficient use of the data than others. This article reviews well-established statistical principles, which provide useful guidance, and argues that good statistical practice can substantially enhance results. Recent work on estimation of firing rate, population coding, and time-varying correlation provides improvements in experimental sensitivity equivalent to large increases in the number of neurons examined. Modern nonparametric methods are applicable to data from repeated trials. Many within-trial analyses based on a Poisson assumption can be extended to non-Poisson data. New methods have made it possible to track changes in receptive fields, and to study trial-to-trial variation, with modest amounts of data.},

The results show that > 95\% of the LFP signal originates within 250 microm of the recording electrode.

A recently proposed decomposition of synergy revealed that redundancy introduced by common tuning preferences is more than just compensated by noise correlations which mostly contributed synergistically. Based on a pooled response code, the contribution of noise correlations diminished resulting in a severe information loss. Thus, to operate economically, cortical neurons should either employ a labeled-line code or, if using pooled responses, be highly selective in choosing afferents.},

Whereas the response properties of the spiking activity in the visual cortex have been characterized extensively, the responses of the LFP have not been well explored. No coherent picture exists about which frequency ranges exhibit feature tuning or show stimulus locked activity. Addressing this, we recorded LFP in the primary visual cortex of alert cats and calculated the tuning indices for orientation, spatial and temporal frequency. Furthermore, we quantified the locking of the power in different LFP frequency bands to the velocity profile of artificial and natural stimuli. We found that the LFP in alert animals is well tuned with similar specificity to orientation, spatial frequency and temporal frequency. Tuning to these features is most prominent in two frequency bands (8-23 Hz and 39-109 Hz). In two complementary frequency bands (23-39 Hz and above 109 Hz) the dynamics of the LFP power is locked tightly to the temporal structure of the stimulus. This locking is furthermore independent of the spatial structure of the stimulus. Together these four frequency bands cover the whole frequency range investigated. In contrast to previous studies, which often reported correlates of visual processing only in a limited frequency range of the LFP, the present results suggest that the entire frequency range of the LFP can be assigned a role in visual processing.},

  abstract      = {In many complex societies, intricate communication and recognition systems may evolve to help support both direct and indirect benefits of group membership. In cooperatively breeding species where groups typically comprise relatives, both learned and innate vocal signals may serve as reliable cues for kin recognition. Here, we investigated vocal communication in the plural cooperatively breeding superb starling, Lamprotornis superbus, where flight calls-short, stereotyped vocalizations used when approaching conspecifics-may communicate kin relationships, group membership, and/or individual identity. We found that flight calls were most similar within individual repertoires but were also more similar within groups than within the larger population. Although starlings responded differently to playback of calls from their own versus other neighboring and distant social groups, call similarity was uncorrelated with genetic relatedness. Additionally, immigrant females showed similar patterns to birds born in the study population. Together, these results suggest that flight calls are learned signals that reflect social association but may also carry a signal of individuality. Flight calls, therefore, provide a reliable recognition mechanism for groups and may also be used to recognize individuals. In complex societies comprising related and unrelated individuals, signaling individuality and group association, rather than kinship, may be a route to cooperation.},

However, neurons that respond to auditory feedback from vocal output have not been found in song-control areas despite intensive searching. Here we investigate feedback processing outside the traditional song system, in single auditory forebrain neurons of juvenile zebra finches that were in a late developmental stage of song learning. Overall, we found similarity of spike responses during singing and during playback of the bird's own song, with song responses commonly leading by a few milliseconds. However, brief time-locked acoustic perturbations of auditory feedback revealed complex sensitivity that could not be predicted from passive playback responses. Some neurons that responded to playback perturbations did not respond to song perturbations, which is reminiscent of sensory-motor mirror neurons. By contrast, some neurons were highly feedback sensitive in that they responded vigorously to song perturbations, but not to unperturbed songs or perturbed playback. These findings suggest that a computational function of forebrain auditory areas may be to detect errors between actual feedback and mirrored feedback deriving from an internal model of the bird's own song or that of its tutor. Such feedback-sensitive spikes could constitute the key signals that trigger adaptive motor responses to song disruptions or reinforce exploratory motor gestures for vocal learning.},

  abstract      = {New neurons integrate in large numbers into the mature olfactory bulb circuit throughout life. The factors controlling the synaptic development of adult-born neurons and their connectivity remain essentially unknown. We examined the role of activity-dependent mechanisms in the synaptic development of adult-born neurons by genetic labeling of synapses while manipulating sensory input or cell-intrinsic excitability. Sensory deprivation induced marked changes in the density of input and output synapses during the period when new neurons develop most of their synapses. In contrast, when sensory deprivation started after synaptic formation was complete, input synapses increased in one domain without detectable changes in the other dendritic domains. We then investigated the effects of genetically raising the intrinsic excitability of new neurons on their synaptic development by delivering a voltage-gated sodium channel that triggers long depolarizations. Surprisingly, genetically increasing excitability did not affect synaptic development but rescued the changes in glutamatergic input synapses caused by sensory deprivation. These experiments show that, during adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb, synaptic plasticity is primarily restricted to an early period during the maturation of new neurons when they are still forming synapses. The addition of cells endowed with such an initial short-lived flexibility and long-term stability may enable the processing of information by the olfactory bulb to be both versatile and reliable in the face of changing behavioral demands.},

  abstract      = {Our mental representation of object categories is hierarchically organized, and our rapid and seemingly effortless categorization ability is crucial for our daily behavior. Here, we examine responses of a large number (>600) of neurons in monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex with a large number (>1,000) of natural and artificial object images. During the recordings, the monkeys performed a passive fixation task. We found that the categorical structure of objects is represented by the pattern of activity distributed over the cell population. Animate and inanimate objects created distinguishable clusters in the population code. The global category of animate objects was divided into bodies, hands, and faces. Faces were divided into primate and nonprimate faces, and the primate-face group was divided into human and monkey faces. Bodies of human, birds, and four-limb animals clustered together, whereas lower animals such as fish, reptile, and insects made another cluster. Thus the cluster analysis showed that IT population responses reconstruct a large part of our intuitive category structure, including the global division into animate and inanimate objects, and further hierarchical subdivisions of animate objects. The representation of categories was distributed in several respects, e.g., the similarity of response patterns to stimuli within a category was maintained by both the cells that maximally responded to the category and the cells that responded weakly to the category. These results advance our understanding of the nature of the IT neural code, suggesting an inherently categorical representation that comprises a range of categories including the amply investigated face category.},

To test whether experience can modify this maximum following rate in adult rats, trains of brief tones with random carrier frequency but fixed repetition rate were paired with electrical stimulation of the nucleus basalis (NB) 300 to 400 times per day for 20-25 days. Pairing NB stimulation with 5-pps stimuli markedly decreased the cortical response to rapidly presented stimuli, whereas pairing with 15-pps stimuli significantly increased the maximum cortical following rate. In contrast, pairing with fixed carrier frequency 15-pps trains did not significantly increase the mean maximum following rate. Thus this protocol elicits extensive cortical remodeling of temporal response properties and demonstrates that simple differences in spectral and temporal features of the sensory input can drive very different cortical reorganizations.},

Diffuse neuromodulatory systems may facilitate cortical plasticity by acting as teachers to mark important stimuli. This study demonstrates that episodic electrical stimulation of the nucleus basalis, paired with an auditory stimulus, results in a massive progressive reorganization of the primary auditory cortex in the adult rat. Receptive field sizes can be narrowed, broadened, or left unaltered depending on specific parameters of the acoustic stimulus paired with nucleus basalis activation. This differential plasticity parallels the receptive field remodeling that results from different types of behavioral training. This result suggests that input characteristics may be able to drive appropriate alterations of receptive fields independently of explicit knowledge of the task. These findings also suggest that the basal forebrain plays an active instructional role in representational plasticity.},

  abstract      = {The cortical representation of the sensory environment is continuously modified by experience. Changes in spatial (receptive field) and temporal response properties of cortical neurons underlie many forms of natural learning. The scale and direction of these changes appear to be determined by specific features of the behavioral tasks that evoke cortical plasticity. The neural mechanisms responsible for this differential plasticity remain unclear partly because important sensory and cognitive parameters differ among these tasks. In this report, we demonstrate that differential sensory experience directs differential plasticity using a single paradigm that eliminates the task-specific variables that have confounded direct comparison of previous studies. Electrical activation of the basal forebrain (BF) was used to gate cortical plasticity mechanisms. The auditory stimulus paired with BF stimulation was systematically varied to determine how several basic features of the sensory input direct plasticity in primary auditory cortex (A1) of adult rats. The distributed cortical response was reconstructed from a dense sampling of A1 neurons after 4 wk of BF-sound pairing. We have previously used this method to show that when a tone is paired with BF activation, the region of the cortical map responding to that tone frequency is specifically expanded. In this report, we demonstrate that receptive-field size is determined by features of the stimulus paired with BF activation. Specifically, receptive fields were narrowed or broadened as a systematic function of both carrier-frequency variability and the temporal modulation rate of paired acoustic stimuli. For example, the mean bandwidth of A1 neurons was increased (+60\%) after pairing BF stimulation with a rapid train of tones and decreased (-25\%) after pairing unmodulated tones of different frequencies. These effects are consistent with previous reports of receptive-field plasticity evoked by natural learning. The maximum cortical following rate and minimum response latency were also modified as a function of stimulus modulation rate and carrier-frequency variability. The cortical response to a rapid train of tones was nearly doubled if BF stimulation was paired with rapid trains of random carrier frequency, while no following rate plasticity was observed if a single carrier frequency was used. Finally, we observed significant increases in response strength and total area of functionally defined A1 following BF activation paired with certain classes of stimuli and not others. These results indicate that the degree and direction of cortical plasticity of temporal and receptive-field selectivity are specified by the structure and schedule of inputs that co-occur with basal forebrain activation and suggest that the rules of cortical plasticity do not operate on each elemental stimulus feature independently of others.},

  abstract      = {Theories of temporal coding by cortical neurons are supported by observations that individual neurons can respond to sensory stimulation with millisecond precision and that activity in large populations is often highly correlated. Synchronization is highest between neurons with overlapping receptive fields and modulated by both sensory stimulation and behavioral state. It is not yet clear whether cortical synchronization is an epiphenomenon or a critical component of efficient information transmission. Experimental manipulations that generate receptive field plasticity can be used to test the relationship between synchronization and receptive fields. Here we demonstrate that increasing receptive field size in primary auditory cortex by repeatedly pairing a train of tones with nucleus basalis (NB) stimulation increases synchronization, and decreasing receptive field size by pairing different tone frequencies with NB stimulation decreases synchronization. These observations seem to support the conclusion that neural synchronization is simply an artifact caused by common inputs. However, pairing tone trains of different carrier frequencies with NB stimulation increases receptive field size without increasing synchronization, and environmental enrichment increases synchronization without increasing receptive field size. The observation that receptive fields and synchronization can be manipulated independently suggests that common inputs are only one of many factors shaping the strength and temporal precision of cortical synchronization and supports the hypothesis that precise neural synchronization contributes to sensory information processing.},

Here, we show that cortical plasticity depends not only on exposure time but also on the temporal modulation rate of the stimulus set. We examined cortical plasticity induced by early exposure to 7 kHz tone pips repeated at a slow (2 Hz), fast (15 Hz), or ethological (6 Hz) rate. Certain rat calls are modulated near 6 Hz. We found that spectral representation of 7 kHz increased only in the ethological-rate-reared animals, whereas improved entrainment of cortical neurons was seen in animals reared in the slow- and fast-rate condition. This temporal rate dependence of spectral plasticity may serve as a filtering mechanism to selectively enlarge representations of species-specific vocalizations. Furthermore, our results indicate that spectral and temporal plasticity can be separately engaged depending on the statistical properties of the input stimuli.},

Previous studies have addressed the modulation of responses of auditory neurons to a current sound in dependence of the immediate stimulation history, but a quantitative analysis of this important computational process has been missing. In this study, we analyzed temporal integration of information in the spike output of 122 single neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) of four awake ferrets in response to random tone sequences. We quantified the information contained in the responses about both current and preceding sounds in two ways: by estimating directly the mutual information between stimulus and response, and by training linear classifiers to decode information about the stimulus from the neural response. We found that 1) many neurons conveyed a significant amount of information not only about the current tone but also simultaneously about the previous tone, 2) the neural response to tone sequences was a nonlinear combination of responses to the tones in isolation, and 3) nevertheless, much of the information about current and previous tones could be extracted by linear decoders. Furthermore, our analysis of these experimental data shows that methods from information theory and the application of standard machine learning methods for extracting specific information yield quite similar results.},

To this end, the complex songs of European starlings have been studied extensively. Yet, several basic parameters of starling individual vocal recognition have not been assessed. Here we investigate the temporal extent of song information acquired by starlings during vocal recognition learning. We trained two groups of starlings using standard operant conditioning techniques to recognize several songs from two conspecific male singers. In the first experiment we tested their ability to maintain accurate recognition when presented with (1) random sequences of 1-12 motifs (stereotyped song components) drawn from the training songs, and (2) 0.1 - 12-s excerpts of continuous song drawn from the training songs. We found that song recognition improved monotonically as more vocal material is provided. In the second experiment, we systematically substituted continuous, varying length regions of white noise for portions of the training songs and again examined recognition accuracy. Recognition remained above chance levels for all noise substitutions tested (up to 91\% of the training stimulus) although all but the smallest substitutions led to some decrement in song recognition. Overall, above chance recognition could be obtained with surprisingly few motifs, short excerpts of song, and in the absence of large portions of the training songs. These results suggest that starlings acquire a representation of song during individual vocal recognition learning that is robust to perturbations and distributed broadly over large portions of these complex acoustic sequences.},

This chapter presents a framework for thinking about attention that facilitates the analysis of this cognitive process in terms of underlying neural mechanisms. Four processes are fundamental to attention: working memory, top-down sensitivity control, competitive selection, and automatic bottom-up filtering for salient stimuli. Each process makes a distinct and essential contribution to attention. Voluntary control of attention involves the first three processes (working memory, top-down sensitivity control, and competitive selection) operating in a recurrent loop. Recent results from neurobiological research on attention are discussed within this framework.},

  abstract      = {Through extensive training, humans can become ``visual experts, '' able to visually distinguish subtle differences among similar objects with greater ease than those who are untrained. To understand the neural mechanisms behind this acquired discrimination ability, adult monkeys were fully trained to discriminate 28 moderately complex shapes. The training effects on the stimulus selectivity of cells in area TE of the inferotemporal cortex were then examined in anesthetized preparations. Area TE represents a later stage of the ventral visual cortical pathway that is known to mediate visual object discrimination and recognition. The recordings from the trained monkeys and untrained controls showed that the proportion of TE cells responsive to some member of the 28 stimuli was significantly greater in the trained monkeys than that in the control monkeys. Cell responses recorded from the trained monkeys were not sharply tuned to single training stimuli, but rather broadly covered several training stimuli. The distances among the training stimuli in the response space spanned by responses of the recorded TE cells were significantly greater in the trained monkeys than those in the control monkeys. The subset of training stimuli to which individual cells responded differed from cell to cell with only partial overlaps, suggesting that the cells responded to features common to several stimuli. These results are consistent with a model in which visual expertise is acquired through the development of differential responses by inferotemporal cells to the images of relevant objects.},

Listeners localized a target click preceded by a distractor click coming from a location fixed throughout a run of trials (either frontal or lateral). The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between distractor and target was relatively long (25-400 ms); control trials presented the target alone. The distractor induced bias and variability in target localization responses even at the longest SOA, with the specific pattern of effects differing between the two rooms. Furthermore, the presence of the distractor caused target responses to be displaced away from the distractor location in that run, even on trials with no distractor. This contextual bias built up anew in each run, over the course of minutes. The different effects illustrate that (a) sound localization is a dynamic process that depends on both the context and on the level of reverberation in the environment, and (b) interactions between sequential sound sources occur on time scales from hundreds of milliseconds to as long as minutes.},

Encouraged by the successful invocation of this principle to predict how neurons encode natural auditory and visual stimuli, we attempted its application to olfactory neurons. The pheromone receptor neuron of the male moth Antheraea polyphemus, for which quantitative properties of both the natural stimulus and the reception processes are available, was selected. We predicted several characteristics that the pheromone plume should possess under the hypothesis that the receptors perform optimally, i.e., transfer as much information on the stimulus per unit time as possible. Our results demonstrate that the statistical characteristics of the predicted stimulus, e.g., the probability distribution function of the stimulus concentration, the spectral density function of the stimulation course, and the intermittency, are in good agreement with those measured experimentally in the field. These results should stimulate further quantitative studies on the evolutionary adaptation of olfactory nervous systems to odorant plumes and on the plume characteristics that are most informative for the 'sniffer'. Both aspects are relevant to the design of olfactory sensors for odour-tracking robots.},

  abstract      = {Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models of neuronal membrane dynamics consist of a set of nonlinear differential equations that describe the time-varying conductance of various ion channels. Using observations of voltage alone we show how to estimate the unknown parameters and unobserved state variables of an HH model in the expected circumstance that the measurements are noisy, the model has errors, and the state of the neuron is not known when observations commence. The joint probability distribution of the observed membrane voltage and the unobserved state variables and parameters of these models is a path integral through the model state space. The solution to this integral allows estimation of the parameters and thus a characterization of many biological properties of interest, including channel complement and density, that give rise to a neuron's electrophysiological behavior. This paper describes a method for directly evaluating the path integral using a Monte Carlo numerical approach. This provides estimates not only of the expected values of model parameters but also of their posterior uncertainty. Using test data simulated from neuronal models comprising several common channels, we show that short (<50 ms) intracellular recordings from neurons stimulated with a complex time-varying current yield accurate and precise estimates of the model parameters as well as accurate predictions of the future behavior of the neuron. We also show that this method is robust to errors in model specification, supporting model development for biological preparations in which the channel expression and other biophysical properties of the neurons are not fully known.},

  abstract      = {A few distinct cortical operations have been postulated over the past few years, suggested by experimental data on nonlinear neural response across different areas in the cortex. Among these, the energy model proposes the summation of quadrature pairs following a squaring nonlinearity in order to explain phase invariance of complex V1 cells. The divisive normalization model assumes a gain-controlling, divisive inhibition to explain sigmoid-like response profiles within a pool of neurons. A gaussian-like operation hypothesizes a bell-shaped response tuned to a specific, optimal pattern of activation of the presynaptic inputs. A max-like operation assumes the selection and transmission of the most active response among a set of neural inputs. We propose that these distinct neural operations can be computed by the same canonical circuitry, involving divisive normalization and polynomial nonlinearities, for different parameter values within the circuit. Hence, this canonical circuit may provide a unifying framework for several circuit models, such as the divisive normalization and the energy models. As a case in point, we consider a feedforward hierarchical model of the ventral pathway of the primate visual cortex, which is built on a combination of the gaussian-like and max-like operations. We show that when the two operations are approximated by the circuit proposed here, the model is capable of generating selective and invariant neural responses and performing object recognition, in good agreement with neurophysiological data.},

In this model, the spike probability depends in a nonlinear way on a small number of stimulus dimensions. The relevant stimulus dimensions can be found by optimizing a R{\'e}nyi divergence that quantifies a change in the stimulus distribution associated with the arrival of single spikes. Generally, good reconstructions can be obtained based on optimization of R{\'e}nyi divergence of any order, even in the limit of small numbers of spikes. However, the smallest error is obtained when the R{\'e}nyi divergence of order 1 is optimized. This type of optimization is equivalent to information maximization, and is shown to saturate the Cramer-Rao bound describing the smallest error allowed for any unbiased method. We also discuss conditions under which information maximization provides a convenient way to perform maximum likelihood estimation of linear-nonlinear models from neural data.},

LFP responses in IT to complex objects showed strong selectivity at 44\% of the sites and tolerance to retinal position and size. The LFP preferences were poorly predicted by the spike preferences at the same site but were better explained by averaging spikes within approximately 3 mm. A comparison of separate sites suggests that selectivity is similar on a scale of approximately 800 microm for spikes and approximately 5 mm for LFPs. These observations imply that inputs to IT neurons convey selectivity for complex shapes and that such input may have an underlying organization spanning several millimeters.},

  abstract      = {In visual areas of the cerebral cortex, most neurons exhibit preferences for particular features of visual stimuli, but in general, the tuning is broad. Thus, even simple stimuli evoke responses in numerous neurons with differing but overlapping feature preferences, and it is commonly held that a particular feature is encoded in the pattern of graded responses of the activated population rather than in the optimal responses of individual cells. To decipher this population code, responses evoked by a particular stimulus need to be identified and bound together for further joint processing and must not be confounded with responses to other, nearby stimuli. Such selection of related responses could be achieved by synchronizing the respective discharges at a time scale of milliseconds, as this would selectively and jointly enhance their saliency. This hypothesis predicts that a given set of neurons should exhibit synchronized discharges more often when responding to a single stimulus than when activated by different but simultaneously presented stimuli. To test this prediction, recordings were performed with two electrodes from spatially segregated cells in the middle temporal area (MT) of the awake behaving macaque monkey. It was found that cells with overlapping receptive fields, but different preferences for directions of motion, can engage in synchronous activity if they are stimulated with a single moving bar. In contrast, if the same cells are activated with two different bars, each moving in the direction preferred by the cells at the two respective sites, responses show no or much fewer synchronous epochs. Control experiments exclude that this effect is attributable to changes in response amplitude, the mere presence of two stimuli, or the specific orientation of the bars. The critical variable determining the strength of correlation is the extent to which both sites are activated by a common stimulus or by two different stimuli with different directions of motion.},

  abstract      = {Measures of multiple spike train synchrony are essential in order to study issues such as spike timing reliability, network synchronization, and neuronal coding. These measures can broadly be divided in multivariate measures and averages over bivariate measures. One of the most recent bivariate approaches, the ISI-distance, employs the ratio of instantaneous interspike intervals (ISIs). In this study we propose two extensions of the ISI-distance, the straightforward averaged bivariate ISI-distance and the multivariate ISI-diversity based on the coefficient of variation. Like the original measure these extensions combine many properties desirable in applications to real data. In particular, they are parameter-free, time scale independent, and easy to visualize in a time-resolved manner, as we illustrate with in vitro recordings from a cortical neuron. Using a simulated network of Hindemarsh-Rose neurons as a controlled configuration we compare the performance of our methods in distinguishing different levels of multi-neuron spike train synchrony to the performance of six other previously published measures. We show and explain why the averaged bivariate measures perform better than the multivariate ones and why the multivariate ISI-diversity is the best performer among the multivariate methods. Finally, in a comparison against standard methods that rely on moving window estimates, we use single-unit monkey data to demonstrate the advantages of the instantaneous nature of our methods.},

This procedure was performed to quantify the contribution of descending corticofugal projections on (i) the normal organization of thalamic somatosensory receptive fields and (ii) the thalamic somatosensory plastic reorganization that immediately follows a peripheral deafferentation. Reversible inactivation of SI cortex resulted in immediate changes in receptive field properties throughout the VPM. Cortical inactivation also significantly reduced but did not completely eliminate the occurrence of VPM receptive field reorganization resulting from the reversible peripheral deafferentation. This result suggests that the thalamic plasticity that is seen immediately after a peripheral deafferentation is dependent upon both descending corticofugal projections and ascending trigeminothalamic projections.},

  abstract      = {Dopamine is a key neuromodulatory transmitter in the brain. It acts through dopamine receptors to affect changes in neural activity, gene expression, and behavior. In songbirds, dopamine is released into the striatal song nucleus Area X, and the levels depend on social contexts of undirected and directed singing. This differential release is associated with differential expression of activity-dependent genes, such as egr1 (avian zenk), which in mammalian brain are modulated by dopamine receptors. Here we cloned from zebra finch brain cDNAs of all avian dopamine receptors: the D1 (D1A, D1B, D1D) and D2 (D2, D3, D4) families. Comparative sequence analyses of predicted proteins revealed expected phylogenetic relationships, in which the D1 family exists as single exon and the D2 family exists as spliced exon genes. In both zebra finch and chicken, the D1A, D1B, and D2 receptors were highly expressed in the striatum, the D1D and D3 throughout the pallium and within the mesopallium, respectively, and the D4 mainly in the cerebellum. Furthermore, within the zebra finch, all receptors, except for D4, showed differential expression in song nuclei relative to the surrounding regions and developmentally regulated expression that decreased for most receptors during the sensory acquisition and sensorimotor phases of song learning. Within Area X, half of the cells expressed both D1A and D2 receptors, and a higher proportion of the D1A-only-containing neurons expressed egr1 during undirected but not during directed singing. Our findings are consistent with hypotheses that dopamine receptors may be involved in song development and social context-dependent behaviors.},

The data show that by the time infants begin to master the higher levels of language--sound-meaning correspondences, contrastive phonology, and grammatical rules--their perceptual and perceptual-motor systems are already tuned to a specific language.

Contigs from de novo assemblies were aligned to the two available avian reference genomes, chicken and zebra finch. In total, we identified 6499 different genes across all 10 species, with approximately 1000 genes found in each full run per species. We found evidence for a higher mutation rate of the Z chromosome than of autosomes (male-biased mutation) and a negative correlation between the neutral substitution rate (d(S)) and chromosome size. Analyses of the mean d(N)/d(S) ratio (omega) of genes across chromosomes supported the Hill-Robertson effect (the effect of selection at linked loci) and point at stochastic problems with omega as an independent measure of selection. Overall, this study demonstrates the usefulness of next-generation sequencing for obtaining genomic resources for comparative genomic analysis of non-model organisms.},

We found that attending to rhythmic auditory streams resulted in the entrainment of ongoing oscillatory activity reflecting rhythmic excitability fluctuations in A1. Strikingly, although the rhythm of the entrained oscillations in A1 neuronal ensembles reflected the temporal structure of the attended stream, the phase depended on the attended frequency content. Counter-phase entrainment across differently tuned A1 regions resulted in both the amplification and sharpening of responses at attended time points, in essence acting as a spectrotemporal filter mechanism. Our data suggest that selective attention generates a dynamically evolving model of attended auditory stimulus streams in the form of modulatory subthreshold oscillations across tonotopically organized neuronal ensembles in A1 that enhances the representation of attended stimuli.},

Here a method is described which provides for the estimation of a temporally precise electrophysiological response to uninterrupted natural speech. We have termed this response AESPA (Auditory Evoked Spread Spectrum Analysis) and it represents an estimate of the impulse response of the auditory system. It is obtained by assuming that the recorded electrophysiological function represents a convolution of the amplitude envelope of a continuous speech stream with the to-be-estimated impulse response. We present examples of these responses using both scalp and intracranially recorded human EEG, which were obtained while subjects listened to a binaurally presented recording of a male speaker reading naturally from a classic work of fiction. This method expands the arsenal of stimulation types that can now be effectively used to derive auditory evoked responses and allows for the use of considerably more ecologically valid stimulation parameters.

  abstract      = {In natural environments complex and continuous auditory stimulation is virtually ubiquitous. The human auditory system has evolved to efficiently process an infinity of everyday sounds, which range from short, simple bursts of noise to signals with a much higher order of information such as speech. Investigation of temporal processing in this system using the event-related potential (ERP) technique has led to great advances in our knowledge. However, this method is restricted by the need to present simple, discrete, repeated stimuli to obtain a useful response. Alternatively the continuous auditory steady-state response is used, although this method reduces the evoked response to its fundamental frequency component at the expense of useful information on the timing of response transmission through the auditory system. In this report, we describe a method for eliciting a novel ERP, which circumvents these limitations, known as the AESPA (auditory-evoked spread spectrum analysis). This method uses rapid amplitude modulation of audio carrier signals to estimate the impulse response of the auditory system. We show AESPA responses with high signal-to-noise ratios obtained using two types of carrier wave: a 1-kHz tone and broadband noise. To characterize these responses, they are compared with auditory-evoked potentials elicited using standard techniques. A number of similarities and differences between the responses are noted and these are discussed in light of the differing stimulation and analysis methods used. Data are presented that demonstrate the generalizability of the AESPA method and a number of applications are proposed.},

  abstract      = {Determining the spatial direction of sound sources is one of the major computations performed by the auditory system. The anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES) of cat cortex is known to be important for sound localization. However, there are contradicting reports as to the spatial response properties of neurons in AES: whereas some studies found narrowly tuned neurons, others reported mostly spatially widely tuned neurons. We hypothesized that this is the result of a nonhomogenous distribution of the auditory neurons in this area. To test this possibility, we recorded neuronal activity along the AES, together with a sample of neurons from primary auditory cortex (A1) of cats in response to pure tones and to virtual acoustic space stimuli. In all areas, most neurons responded to both types of stimuli. Neurons located in posterior AES (pAES) showed special response properties that distinguished them from neurons in A1 and from neurons in anterior AES (aAES). The proportion of space-selective neurons among auditory neurons was significantly higher in pAES (82\%) than in A1 (72\%) and in aAES (60\%). Furthermore, whereas the large majority of A1 neurons responded preferentially to contralateral sounds, neurons in pAES (and to a lesser extent in aAES) had their spatial selectivity distributed more homogenously. In particular, 28\% of the space-selective neurons in pAES had highly modulated frontal receptive fields, against 8\% in A1 and 17\% in aAES. We conclude that in cats, pAES contains a secondary auditory cortical field which is specialized for spatial processing, in particular for the representation of frontal space.},

A possible neuronal correlate of this phenomenon is the ability of low-level tones to suppress neuronal locking to the envelope of the fluctuating noise (``locking suppression''). Using in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings in cats, we studied neuronal responses to combinations of fluctuating noise and tones in three successive auditory stations: inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate body (MGB), and primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that although the most sensitive responses in the IC were approximately isomorphic to the physical structure of the sounds, with only a small perturbation in the responses to the fluctuating noise after the addition of low-level tones, some neurons in the MGB and all A1 neurons displayed striking suppressive effects. These neurons were hypersensitive, showing suppression already with tone levels lower than the threshold of the neurons in silence. The hypersensitive locking suppression in A1 and MGB had a special timing structure, starting >75 ms after tone onset. Our findings show a qualitative change in the representation of tone in fluctuating noise along the IC-MGB-A1 axis, suggesting the gradual segregation of signal from noise and the representation of the signal as a separate perceptual object in A1.},

  abstract      = {Decoding the activity of a population of neurons is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A key aspect of this problem is determining whether correlations in the activity, i.e., noise correlations, are important. If they are important, then the decoding problem is high dimensional: decoding algorithms must take the correlational structure in the activity into account. If they are not important, or if they play a minor role, then the decoding problem can be reduced to lower dimension and thus made more tractable. The issue of whether correlations are important has been a subject of heated debate. The debate centers around the validity of the measures used to address it. Here, we evaluate three of the most commonly used ones: synergy, DeltaI(shuffled), and DeltaI. We show that synergy and DeltaI(shuffled) are confounded measures: they can be zero when correlations are clearly important for decoding and positive when they are not. In contrast, DeltaI is not confounded. It is zero only when correlations are not important for decoding and positive only when they are; that is, it is zero only when one can decode exactly as well using a decoder that ignores correlations as one can using a decoder that does not, and it is positive only when one cannot decode as well. Finally, we show that DeltaI has an information theoretic interpretation; it is an upper bound on the information lost when correlations are ignored.},

This review begins by exploring the different strengths and limitations inherent to different neuroimaging methods, and then outlines some common behavioral paradigms that have been adopted to study auditory attention. We argue that in order to design a neuroimaging experiment that produces interpretable, unambiguous results, the experimenter must not only have a deep appreciation of the imaging technique employed, but also a sophisticated understanding of perception and behavior. Only with the proper caveats in mind can one begin to infer how the cortex supports a human in solving the ``cocktail party'' problem.

The animals were trained to move their arms in one of eight directions as instructed by a visual target. The relationship between variability (SD) and mean of the discharge rate was described by a power function with a similar exponent ( approximately 0.57), regardless of the cortical area or the behavioral condition. We examined whether the deviation from mean activity between target onset and the end of the movement was correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with variability in activity during the hold period before target onset. In both cortical areas, for about a quarter of the neurons, the neuronal noise of these two periods was positively correlated, whereas significant negative correlations were seldom observed. Overall, neurons with higher signal correlation (i.e., similar directional pattern) showed higher noise correlation in both cortical areas. On the other hand, when the data were divided according to the distance between the electrode tips from which the neurons were recorded, a consistent relationship between the signal and noise correlations was found only for pairs of neurons recorded through the same electrode. These results suggest that nearby neurons with similar directional tuning carry primarily redundant messages, whereas neurons in separate cortical columns perform more independent processing.},

  abstract      = {Probability distributions of macaque complex cell responses to a large set of images were determined. Measures of selectivity were based on the overall shape of the response probability distribution, as quantified by either kurtosis or entropy. We call this non-parametric selectivity, in contrast to parametric selectivity, which measures tuning curve bandwidths. To examine how receptive field properties affected non-parametric selectivity, two models of complex cells were created. One was a standard Gabor energy model, and the other a slight variant constructed from a Gabor function and its Hilbert transform. Functionally, these models differed primarily in the size of their DC responses. The Hilbert model produced higher selectivities than the Gabor model, with the two models bracketing the data from above and below. Thus we see that tiny changes in the receptive field profiles can lead to major changes in selectivity. While selectivity looks at the response distribution of a single neuron across a set of stimuli, sparseness looks at the response distribution of a population of neurons to a single stimulus. In the model, we found that on average the sparseness of a population was equal to the selectivity of cells comprising that population, a property we call ergodicity. We raise the possibility that high sparseness is the result of distortions in the shape of response distributions caused by non-linear, information-losing transforms, unrelated to information theoretic issues of efficient coding.},

The form of the code depends on sound class, resembling a Fourier transformation when optimized for animal vocalizations and a wavelet transformation when optimized for non-biological environmental sounds. Only for the combined set does the optimal code follow scaling characteristics of physiological data.

  abstract      = {1. The inferior temporal (IT) cortex plays an important role in both short- and long-term memory for visual patterns. Most previous studies of IT neurons have tested their responses in recency memory tasks, which require that the memory lasts only the length of a single behavioral trial, which may be < 1 s. To determine the role of IT neurons in longer lasting memories, we measured their responses to initially novel stimuli as the stimuli gradually became familiar to the animal. 2. Two rhesus monkeys were trained on a delayed matching to sample (DMS) task with several intervening stimuli between the sample and the final matching stimulus on each trial. The purpose of the task was to ensure that the animal attended to the stimuli and held them in memory, at least temporarily. Unlike in several previous studies, the focus was not on within-trial effects but rather on the incidental memories that built up across trials as the stimuli became familiar. Each cell was tested with a set of 20 novel stimuli (digitized pictures of objects) that the monkey had not seen before. These stimuli were used in a fixed order over the course of an hour-long recording session, and the number of intervening trials between repetitions of a given sample stimulus was varied. 3. The responses of about one-third of the cells recorded in anterior-ventral IT cortex declined systematically as the novel stimuli became familiar. After six to eight repetitions, responses reached a plateau that was approximately 40\% of the peak response. Virtually all of these cells also showed selectivity for particular visual stimuli and thus were not ``novelty detectors'' in the sense of cells that respond to any novel stimulus. Rather, the responses of these cells were a joint function of familiarity and specific object features such as shape and color. A few cells showed increasing responses with repetition over the recording session, but these changes were accompanied by changes in baseline firing rate, suggesting that they were caused by nonspecific effects. 4. The decrement in response with familiarity was stimulus specific and bridged > 150 presentations of other stimuli, the maximum tested. For some cells the maximum decrement in response occurred for those stimuli that initially elicited the largest response. There was no significant change in response to stimuli that were already familiar. 5. The same cells that showed familiarity effects also showed reduced responses to the matching stimuli at the end of each trial, compared with the responses to the samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Indeed, the same olfactory input may generate different odor percepts depending on prior learning and experience. Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with an olfactory paradigm of perceptual learning, we examined how sensory experience modifies odor perception and odor quality coding in the human brain. Prolonged exposure to a target odorant enhanced perceptual differentiation for odorants related in odor quality or functional group, an effect that was paralleled by learning-induced response increases in piriform cortex and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Critically, the magnitude of OFC activation predicted subsequent improvement in behavioral differentiation. Our findings suggest that neural representations of odor quality can be rapidly updated through mere perceptual experience, a mechanism that may underlie the development of odor perception.},

Here we show that for monkeys trained in a shape discrimination task, V1 neurons took on novel functional properties related to the attributes of the trained shapes. Furthermore, these properties depended on the perceptual task being performed; neurons responded very differently to an identical visual stimulus under different visual discrimination tasks. These top-down influences were seen from the very beginning and throughout the entire time course of the neural responses. Information theoretic analysis showed that neurons carried more information about a stimulus attribute when the animals were performing a task related to that attribute. Our findings suggest that the output from V1 reflects both sensory and behavioral context.},

To determine whether and what proportion of single neurons in aIT cortex can yield enough information to classify complex images, we recorded from aIT neurons during the presentation of morphed photographic images in sessions in which monkeys classified images in a two alternative forced-choice--delayed-match-to-sample (2AFC-DMS) task or in sessions in which they performed a fixation task. The sample stimuli were chosen from a sequence in which one image was gradually morphed into another in a pair, while the original pair of images served as choices. Responses of many individual neurons in aIT cortex during the behavioral classification of the images, decoded using an ideal observer analysis, were sufficiently selective to account for the observed behavioral classification of the images. The responses of a separate population of neurons in aIT cortex recorded in subsequent sessions while the monkeys viewed the same images, were less selective than neural responses measured during sessions in which the 2AFC-DMS task was performed. Our findings show that many neurons in aIT could provide sensory information sufficient for the classification of images when a 2AFC-DMS task was performed.},

  abstract      = {We propose a model of the primary auditory cortex (A1), in which each iso-frequency column is represented by a recurrent neural network with short-term synaptic depression. Such networks can emit Population Spikes, in which most of the neurons fire synchronously for a short time period. Different columns are interconnected in a way that reflects the tonotopic map in A1, and population spikes can propagate along the map from one column to the next, in a temporally precise manner that depends on the specific input presented to the network. The network, therefore, processes incoming sounds by precise sequences of population spikes that are embedded in a continuous asynchronous activity, with both of these response components carrying information about the inputs and interacting with each other. With these basic characteristics, the model can account for a wide range of experimental findings. We reproduce neuronal frequency tuning curves, whose width depends on the strength of the intracortical inhibitory and excitatory connections. Non-simultaneous two-tone stimuli show forward masking depending on their temporal separation, as well as on the duration of the first stimulus. The model also exhibits non-linear suppressive interactions between sub-threshold tones and broad-band noise inputs, similar to the hypersensitive locking suppression recently demonstrated in auditory cortex. We derive several predictions from the model. In particular, we predict that spontaneous activity in primary auditory cortex gates the temporally locked responses of A1 neurons to auditory stimuli. Spontaneous activity could, therefore, be a mechanism for rapid and reversible modulation of cortical processing.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: The inferior temporal cortex (IT) of the monkey has long been known to play an essential role in visual object recognition. Damage to this area results in severe deficits in perceptual learning and object recognition, without significantly affecting basic visual capacities. Consistent with these ablation studies is the discovery of IT neurons that respond to complex two-dimensional visual patterns, or objects such as faces or body parts. What is the role of these neurons in object recognition? Is such a complex configurational selectivity specific to biologically meaningful objects, or does it develop as a result of extensive exposure to any objects whose identification relies on subtle shape differences? If so, would IT neurons respond selectively to recently learned views of features of novel objects? The present study addresses this question by using combined psychophysical and electrophysiological experiments, in which monkeys learned to classify and recognize computer-generated three-dimensional objects. RESULTS: A population of IT neurons was found that responded selectively to views of previously unfamiliar objects. The cells discharged maximally to one view of an object, and their response declined gradually as the object was rotated away from this preferred view. No selective responses were ever encountered for views that the animal systematically failed to recognize. Most neurons also exhibited orientation-dependent responses during view-plane rotations. Some neurons were found to be tuned around two views of the same object, and a very small number of cells responded in a view-invariant manner. For the five different objects that were used extensively during the training of the animals, and for which behavioral performance became view-independent, multiple cells were found that were tuned around different views of the same object. A number of view-selective units showed response invariance for changes in the size of the object or the position of its image within the parafovea. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that IT neurons can develop a complex receptive field organization as a consequence of extensive training in the discrimination and recognition of objects. None of these objects had any prior meaning for the animal, nor did they resemble anything familiar in the monkey's environment. Simple geometric features did not appear to account for the neurons' selective responses. These findings support the idea that a population of neurons--each tuned to a different object aspect, and each showing a certain degree of invariance to image transformations--may, as an ensemble, encode at least some types of complex three-dimensional objects. In such a system, several neurons may be active for any given vantage point, with a single unit acting like a blurred template for a limited neighborhood of a single view.},

  abstract      = {Many complex behaviours, like speech or music, have a hierarchical organization with structure on many timescales, but it is not known how the brain controls the timing of behavioural sequences, or whether different circuits control different timescales of the behaviour. Here we address these issues by using temperature to manipulate the biophysical dynamics in different regions of the songbird forebrain involved in song production. We find that cooling the premotor nucleus HVC (formerly known as the high vocal centre) slows song speed across all timescales by up to 45 per cent but only slightly alters the acoustic structure, whereas cooling the downstream motor nucleus RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) has no observable effect on song timing. Our observations suggest that dynamics within HVC are involved in the control of song timing, perhaps through a chain-like organization. Local manipulation of brain temperature should be broadly applicable to the identification of neural circuitry that controls the timing of behavioural sequences and, more generally, to the study of the origin and role of oscillatory and other forms of brain dynamics in neural systems.},

To investigate the structure of these patterns, we recorded from populations of 40-100 neurons in auditory and somatosensory cortices of anesthetized and awake rats using silicon microelectrodes. Population spike time patterns were broadly conserved across multiple sensory stimuli and spontaneous events. Although individual neurons showed timing variations between stimuli, these were not sufficient to disturb a generally conserved sequential organization observed at the population level, lasting for approximately 100 ms with spiking reliability decaying progressively after event onset. Preserved constraints were also seen in population firing rate vectors, with vectors evoked by individual stimuli occupying subspaces of a larger but still constrained space outlined by the set of spontaneous events. These results suggest that population spike patterns are drawn from a limited ``vocabulary,'' sampled widely by spontaneous events but more narrowly by sensory responses.},

Together with anatomical and physiological methods, cell-type-specific expression of protein markers and sensors and transducers will be critical to construct circuit diagrams and to measure the activity of genetically defined neurons. Inactivation and activation of genetically defined cell types will establish causal relationships between activity in specific groups of neurons, circuit function, and animal behavior. Genetic analysis thus promises to reveal the logic of the neural circuits in complex brains that guide behaviors.

  abstract      = {Auditory conditioning (associative learning) or focal electric stimulation of the primary auditory cortex (AC) evokes reorganization (plasticity) of the cochleotopic (frequency) map of the inferior colliculus (IC) as well as that of the AC. The reorganization results from shifts in the best frequencies (BFs) and frequency-tuning curves of single neurons. Since the importance of the cholinergic basal forebrain for cortical plasticity and the importance of the somatosensory cortex and the corticofugal auditory system for collicular and cortical plasticity have been demonstrated, Gao and Suga proposed a hypothesis that states that the AC and corticofugal system play an important role in evoking auditory collicular and cortical plasticity and that auditory and somatosensory signals from the cerebral cortex to the basal forebrain play an important role in augmenting collicular and cortical plasticity. To test their hypothesis, we studied whether the amount and the duration of plasticity of both collicular and cortical neurons evoked by electric stimulation of the AC or by acoustic stimulation were increased by electric stimulation of the basal forebrain and/or the somatosensory cortex. In adult big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), we made the following major findings. 1) Collicular and cortical plasticity evoked by electric stimulation of the AC is augmented by electric stimulation of the basal forebrain. The amount of augmentation is larger for cortical plasticity than for collicular plasticity. 2) Collicular and cortical plasticity evoked by AC stimulation is augmented by somatosensory cortical stimulation mimicking fear conditioning. The amount of augmentation is larger for cortical plasticity than for collicular plasticity. 3) Collicular and cortical plasticity evoked by both AC and basal forebrain stimulations is further augmented by somatosensory cortical stimulation. 4) A lesion of the basal forebrain tends to reduce collicular and cortical plasticity evoked by AC stimulation. The reduction is small and statistically insignificant for collicular plasticity but significant for cortical plasticity. 5) The lesion of the basal forebrain eliminates the augmentation of collicular and cortical plasticity that otherwise would be evoked by somatosensory cortical stimulation. 6) Collicular and cortical plasticity evoked by repetitive acoustic stimuli is augmented by basal forebrain and/or somatosensory cortical stimulation. However, the lesion of the basal forebrain eliminates the augmentation of collicular and cortical plasticity that otherwise would be evoked by somatosensory cortical stimulation. These findings support the hypothesis proposed by Gao and Suga.},

However, following lesion to cHV (caudal hyperstriatum ventrale, an auditory area) females performed courtship displays at high rates in response to both conspecific and heterospecific song. Thus cHV, but not HVc, must be intact for female zebra finches to exhibit normal song preferences.

Sampling from the model is computationally very efficient and, in particular, feasible even for large populations of neurons. The entropy of the model is close to the theoretical maximum for a wide range of parameters. In addition, this framework naturally extends to correlations over time and offers an elegant way to model correlated neural spike counts with arbitrary marginal distributions.},

  abstract      = {Our inferences about brain mechanisms underlying perception rely on whether it is possible for the brain to 'reconstruct' a stimulus from the information contained in the spike trains from many neurons. How the brain actually accomplishes this reconstruction remains largely unknown. Oscillatory and synchronized activities in the brain of mammals have been correlated with distinct behavioural states or the execution of complex cognitive tasks and are proposed to participate in the 'binding' of individual features into more complex percepts. But if synchronization is indeed relevant, what senses it? In insects, oscillatory synchronized activity in the early olfactory system seems to be necessary for fine odour discrimination and enables the encoding of information about a stimulus in spike times relative to the oscillatory 'clock. Here we study the decoding of these coherent oscillatory signals. We identify a population of neurons downstream from the odour-activated, synchronized neuronal assemblies. These downstream neurons show odour responses whose specificity is degraded when their inputs are desynchronized. This degradation of selectivity consists of the appearance of responses to new odours and a loss of discrimination of spike trains evoked by different odours. Such loss of information is never observed in the upstream neurons whose activity is desynchronized. These results indicate that information encoded in time across ensembles of neurons converges onto single neurons downstream in the pathway.},

First, we measured the joint distribution of luminance and contrast in patches selected from natural images and found that luminance and contrast were statistically independent of each other. This independence did not hold for artificial images with matched spectral characteristics. Second, we characterized the effects of the adaptive mechanisms in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the direct recipient of retinal outputs. We found that luminance gain control had the same effect at all contrasts and that contrast gain control had the same effect at all mean luminances. Thus, the adaptive mechanisms for luminance and contrast operate independently, reflecting the very independence encountered in natural images.},

  abstract      = {Songbirds such as the white-crowned sparrow memorize the song of conspecific adults during a critical period early in life and later in life develop song by utilizing auditory feedback. Neurons in one of the telencephalic nuclei controlling song have recently been shown to respond to acoustic stimuli. I investigated the auditory response properties of units in this nucleus using a technique that permitted great flexibility in manipulating complex stimuli such as song. A few of the units exhibited considerable selectivity for the individual's own song. In wild-caught birds, song-specific units exhibited intradialect selectivity. In those birds that sang abnormal songs due to laboratory manipulation of song exposure during the critical period for song learning, units were selective for the abnormal songs. By systematic modification of a song, and by construction of complex synthetic sounds mimicking song, the acoustic parameters responsible for the response selectivity were identified. Song-specific units responded to sequences of two song parts but not to the parts in isolation. Modification of the frequencies of either part of the sequence, or increasing the interval between the parts, varied the strength of the response. Thus, temporal as well as spectral parameters were important for the response. When sequences of synthetic sounds mimicking song were effective in evoking an excitatory response, the response was sensitive to the aforementioned manipulations. Wih these techniques it was possible to elucidate the acoustic parameters required to excite song-specific units. All songs of the repertoire eliciting a strong excitatory response contained the appropriate parameters, which were missing from all weakly effective, ineffective, or inhibitory songs.},

A subset of these auditory neurons in the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) have been shown to be highly selective for the individual bird's own (autogenous) song. By using multiunit recording techniques to sample from a large population, we demonstrate that the entire population of auditory neurons in the HVc is selective for autogenous song. The selectivity of these neurons must reflect the song-learning process, for the acoustic parameters of a sparrow's song are acquired by learning. By testing with laboratory-reared birds, we show that HVc auditory neurons prefer autogenous song over the tutor model to which the birds were exposed early in life. Thus, these neurons must be specified at or after the time song crystallizes. Since song is learned by reference to auditory feedback, HVc auditory neurons may guide the development of the motor program for song. The maintenance of a precise auditory representation of autogenous song into adulthood can contribute to the ability to distinguish the fine differences among conspecific songs.},

This has created the need for statistical approaches to detecting the presence of spatiotemporal patterns of more than two neurons in neuron spike train data. We mention three possible measures for the presence of higher-order patterns of neural activation--coefficients of log-linear models, connected cumulants, and redundancies--and present arguments in favor of the coefficients of log-linear models. We present test statistics for detecting the presence of higher-order interactions in spike train data by parameterizing these interactions in terms of coefficients of log-linear models. We also present a Bayesian approach for inferring the existence or absence of interactions and estimating their strength. The two methods, the frequentist and the Bayesian one, are shown to be consistent in the sense that interactions that are detected by either method also tend to be detected by the other. A heuristic for the analysis of temporal patterns is also proposed. Finally, a Bayesian test is presented that establishes stochastic differences between recorded segments of data. The methods are applied to experimental data and synthetic data drawn from our statistical models. Our experimental data are drawn from multiunit recordings in the prefrontal cortex of behaving monkeys, the somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats, and multiunit recordings in the visual cortex of behaving monkeys.},

To evaluate how reliably the average spike rate of a group of cortical neurons can represent a time-varying signal, we simulated an ensemble with realistic spike discharge behavior. We found that weak interneuronal correlation, or synchrony, allows the variability in spike rates of individual neurons to compromise the ensemble representation of time-varying signals. Brief cycles of sinusoidal modulation at frequencies above 115 Hz could not be represented by an ensemble of hundreds of neurons whose interneuronal correlation mimics that of the visual cortex. The spike variability and correlation assumed in our simulations are likely to apply to many areas of cortex and therefore may constrain the fidelity of neural computations underlying higher brain function.},

Yet, the role of this kind of activity in encoding sensory information remains largely unknown. To understand the rules of translation between the structure of sensory stimuli and the fluctuations of cortical responses, we simulated a sparsely connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons modeling a local cortical population, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encode information about input stimuli. We first considered simple static and periodic stimuli and then naturalistic input stimuli based on electrophysiological recordings from the thalamus of anesthetized monkeys watching natural movie scenes. We found that the simulated network produced stimulus-related LFP changes that were in striking agreement with the LFPs obtained from the primary visual cortex. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the network encoded static input spike rates into gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory-excitatory neural interactions and encoded slow dynamic features of the input into slow LFP fluctuations mediated by stimulus-neural interactions. The model cortical network processed dynamic stimuli with naturalistic temporal structure by using low and high response frequencies as independent communication channels, again in agreement with recent reports from visual cortex responses to naturalistic movies. One potential function of this frequency decomposition into independent information channels operated by the cortical network may be that of enhancing the capacity of the cortical column to encode our complex sensory environment.},

  abstract      = {Despite the widespread use of EEGs to measure the large-scale dynamics of the human brain, little is known on how the dynamics of EEGs relates to that of the underlying spike rates of cortical neurons. However, progress was made by recent neurophysiological experiments reporting that EEG delta-band phase and gamma-band amplitude reliably predict some complementary aspects of the time course of spikes of visual cortical neurons. To elucidate the mechanisms behind these findings, here we hypothesize that the EEG delta phase reflects shifts of local cortical excitability arising from slow fluctuations in the network input due to entrainment to sensory stimuli or to fluctuations in ongoing activity, and that the resulting local excitability fluctuations modulate both the spike rate and the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops producing gamma-band oscillations. We quantitatively tested these hypotheses by simulating a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons stimulated with dynamic inputs presenting temporal regularities similar to that of thalamic responses during naturalistic visual stimulation and during spontaneous activity. The network model reproduced in detail the experimental relationships between spike rate and EEGs, and suggested that the complementariness of the prediction of spike rates obtained from EEG delta phase or gamma amplitude arises from nonlinearities in the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops and from temporal modulations in the amplitude of the network input, which respectively limit the predictability of spike rates from gamma amplitude or delta phase alone. The model suggested also ways to improve and extend current algorithms for online prediction of spike rates from EEGs.},

  abstract      = {Applications of acetylcholine (AcCho) to pyramidal cells of guinea pig cingulate cortical slices maintained in vitro result in a short latency inhibition, followed by a prolonged increase in excitability. Cholinergic inhibition is mediated through the rapid excitation of interneurons that utilize the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This rapid excitation of interneurons is associated with a membrane depolarization and a decrease in neuronal input resistance. In contrast, AcCho-induced excitation of pyramidal cells is due to a direct action that produces a voltage-dependent increase in input resistance. In the experiments reported here, we investigated the possibility that these two responses are mediated by different subclasses of cholinergic receptors. The inhibitory and slow excitatory responses of pyramidal neurons were blocked by muscarinic but not by nicotinic antagonists. Pirenzepine was more effective in blocking the AcCho-induced slow depolarization than in blocking the hyperpolarization of pyramidal neurons. The two responses also varied in their sensitivity to various cholinergic agonists, making it possible to selectively activate either. These data suggest that AcCho may produce two physiologically and pharmacologically distinct muscarinic responses on neocortical neurons: slowly developing voltage-dependent depolarizations associated with an increase in input resistance in pyramidal cells and short-latency depolarizations associated with a decrease in input resistance in presumed GABAergic interneurons.},

We addressed this issue using as a model system the pathways from the functionally distinct prefrontal areas 10 and 32 to auditory association cortex, and investigated their relationship to inhibitory neurons labeled for calbindin (CB) or parvalbumin (PV), which differ in mode of inhibition. Projection neurons in area 10 originated mostly in layers 2-3 and were intermingled with CB inhibitory neurons. In contrast, projections from area 32 originated predominantly in layers 5-6 among PV inhibitory neurons. Prefrontal axonal boutons terminating in layers 2-3 of auditory association cortex were larger than those terminating in layer 1. Most prefrontal axons synapsed on spines of excitatory neurons but a significant number targeted dendritic shafts of inhibitory neurons. Axons from area 10 targeted CB and PV inhibitory neurons, whereas axons from area 32 targeted PV inhibitory neurons. The preferential association of the 2 prefrontal pathways with distinct classes of inhibitory neurons at their origin and termination may reflect the specialization of area 10 in working memory functions and area 32 in emotional communication.

Laminar event-related potential (ERP), current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity (MUA) profiles allowed identification of processes occurring in the local ensembles, as well as their sequence and laminar distribution. These methods also permitted us to analyze the brain processes reflected in attention-sensitive components of the surface ERP. As outlined in the previous study, the first robust modulation by attention occurred in V4 during the 100-300 ms poststimulus interval. This is the time frame of the net refractoriness which follows the net local excitatory response to luminance increment. Over this interval, attention reduced CSD amplitudes and increased action potential firing rates, findings consistent with disinhibition as a mechanism for attention in V4. Similar effects were observed during the 100-300 ms time frame in V2. In V4, attention had no effect on the initial excitatory response at the depth of lamina 4, but it did produce large modulations in supragranular and deep laminae, origins of both feedforward and feedback projections. Attentional modulation in V2 was later than in V4 and concentrated in extragranular laminae, with no modulation of the initial layer 4 response. Attentional modulation in V1 was smaller and still later than that in V2 and was focused in the supragranular laminae. In this paradigm, attention did not modulate either the response in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) or the initial excitation in lamina 4C of V1. The timing of effects across areas and the laminar distribution of effects within areas indicate that attention effects are mediated by feedback projections. Moreover, our findings suggest that attention may increase the perceptual salience of stimuli by reducing stimulus-evoked refractoriness and/or inhibition in cortical ensembles. Finally, attentional modulation of transmembrane current flow in V4 produced a sustained negative deflection in the laminar ERP profile, that was manifested in the ERP over the occipital surface. This posits a mechanism for the 'selection negativity', a scalp ERP effect noted under similar experimental conditions in human subjects.},

  abstract      = {The functional organization giving rise to stimulus selectivity in higher-order auditory neurons remains under active study. We explored the selectivity for motifs, spectrotemporally distinct perceptual units in starling song, recording the responses of 96 caudomedial mesopallium (CMM) neurons in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) under awake-restrained and urethane-anesthetized conditions. A subset of neurons was highly selective between motifs. Selectivity was correlated with low spontaneous firing rates and high spike timing precision, and all but one of the selective neurons had similar spike waveforms. Neurons were further tested with stimuli in which the notes comprising the motifs were manipulated. Responses to most of the isolated notes were similar in amplitude, duration, and temporal pattern to the responses elicited by those notes in the context of the motif. For these neurons, we could accurately predict the responses to motifs from the sum of the responses to notes. Some notes were suppressed by the motif context, such that removing other notes from motifs unmasked additional excitation. Models of linear summation of note responses consistently outperformed spectrotemporal receptive field models in predicting responses to song stimuli. Tests with randomized sequences of notes confirmed the predictive power of these models. Whole notes gave better predictions than did note fragments. Thus in CMM, auditory objects (motifs) can be represented by a linear combination of excitation and suppression elicited by the note components of the object. We hypothesize that the receptive fields arise from selective convergence by inputs responding to specific spectrotemporal features of starling notes.},

Many methods for computing similarity have been developed, but their performance has not been extensively characterized in noisy environments and with vocalizations characterized by complex frequency modulations. This paper describes methods of bioacoustic comparison based on dynamic time warping (DTW) of the fundamental frequency or spectrogram. Fundamental frequency is estimated using a Bayesian particle filter adaptation of harmonic template matching. The methods were tested on field recordings of flight calls from superb starlings, Lamprotornis superbus, for how well they could separate distinct categories of call elements (motifs). The fundamental-frequency-based method performed best, but the spectrogram-based method was less sensitive to noise. Both DTW methods provided better separation of categories than spectrographic cross correlation, likely due to substantial variability in the duration of superb starling flight call motifs.},

  abstract      = {The ability to recognize auditory objects like words and bird songs is thought to depend on neural responses that are selective between categories of the objects and tolerant of variation within those categories. To determine whether a hierarchy of increasing selectivity and tolerance exists in the avian auditory system, we trained European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to differentially recognize sets of songs, then measured extracellular single unit responses under urethane anesthesia in six areas of the auditory cortex. Responses were analyzed with a novel, generalized linear mixed model that provides robust estimates of the variance in responses to different stimuli. There were significant differences between areas in selectivity, tolerance, and the effects of training. The L2b and L1 subdivisions of field L had the least selectivity and tolerance. The caudal nidopallium (NCM) and subdivision L3 of field L were more selective than other areas, whereas the medial and lateral caudal mesopallium were more tolerant than NCM or L2b. L3 had a multimodal distribution of tolerance. Sensitivity to songs that were familiar and those that were not also distinguished the responses of caudomedial mesopallium and NCM. There were significant differences across areas between neurons with wide and narrow spikes. Collectively these results do not fit the traditional hierarchical view of the avian auditory forebrain, but are consistent with emerging concepts homologizing avian cortical and neocortical circuitry. The results suggest a functional divergence within the cortex into processing streams that respond to complementary aspects of the variability in communicative sounds.},

The adequacy of crosscorrelation procedures to detect and estimate neural connectivity has been investigated by means of computer simulations of small networks composed of fairly realistic modelneurons. If the mean interval of neural firings is much larger than the duration of postsynaptic potentials, which will be the case in many central brain areas excitatory connections are easier to detect than inhibitory ones. On the other hand, inhibitory connections are revealed better if the mean firing interval is much smaller than post-synaptic potential duration. In general the effects of external stimuli and the effects of neural connectivity do not add linearly. Furthermore, neurons may exhibit a certain degree of timelock to the stimulus. For these reasons the commonly applied ``shift predictor'' procedure to separate stimulus and neural effects appears to be of limited value. In case of parallel direct and indirect neural pathways between two neurons crosscorrelation analysis does not estimate the direct connection but instead an effective connectivity, which reflects the combined influences of the parallel pathways.},

How the auditory system manages to extract intelligible speech under such acoustically complex and adverse listening conditions is not known, and, indeed, it is not clear how attended speech is internally represented. Here, using multi-electrode surface recordings from the cortex of subjects engaged in a listening task with two simultaneous speakers, we demonstrate that population responses in non-primary human auditory cortex encode critical features of attended speech: speech spectrograms reconstructed based on cortical responses to the mixture of speakers reveal the salient spectral and temporal features of the attended speaker, as if subjects were listening to that speaker alone. A simple classifier trained solely on examples of single speakers can decode both attended words and speaker identity. We find that task performance is well predicted by a rapid increase in attention-modulated neural selectivity across both single-electrode and population-level cortical responses. These findings demonstrate that the cortical representation of speech does not merely reflect the external acoustic environment, but instead gives rise to the perceptual aspects relevant for the listener's intended goal.},

  abstract      = {A controversial issue in neurolinguistics is whether basic neural auditory representations found in many animals can account for human perception of speech. This question was addressed by examining how a population of neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of the naive awake ferret encodes phonemes and whether this representation could account for the human ability to discriminate them. When neural responses were characterized and ordered by spectral tuning and dynamics, perceptually significant features including formant patterns in vowels and place and manner of articulation in consonants, were readily visualized by activity in distinct neural subpopulations. Furthermore, these responses faithfully encoded the similarity between the acoustic features of these phonemes. A simple classifier trained on the neural representation was able to simulate human phoneme confusion when tested with novel exemplars. These results suggest that A1 responses are sufficiently rich to encode and discriminate phoneme classes and that humans and animals may build upon the same general acoustic representations to learn boundaries for categorical and robust sound classification.},

  abstract      = {Population responses of cortical neurons encode considerable details about sensory stimuli, and the encoded information is likely to change with stimulus context and behavioral conditions. The details of encoding are difficult to discern across large sets of single neuron data because of the complexity of naturally occurring stimulus features and cortical receptive fields. To overcome this problem, we used the method of stimulus reconstruction to study how complex sounds are encoded in primary auditory cortex (AI). This method uses a linear spectro-temporal model to map neural population responses to an estimate of the stimulus spectrogram, thereby enabling a direct comparison between the original stimulus and its reconstruction. By assessing the fidelity of such reconstructions from responses to modulated noise stimuli, we estimated the range over which AI neurons can faithfully encode spectro-temporal features. For stimuli containing statistical regularities (typical of those found in complex natural sounds), we found that knowledge of these regularities substantially improves reconstruction accuracy over reconstructions that do not take advantage of this prior knowledge. Finally, contrasting stimulus reconstructions under different behavioral states showed a novel view of the rapid changes in spectro-temporal response properties induced by attentional and motivational state.},

Such modulatory changes selectively enhance overall cortical responsiveness to target (foreground) sounds and thus increase the likelihood of detection against the background of reference sounds. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to describe how enhancing discrimination between two arbitrary classes of sounds can lead to the observed receptive field changes in a variety of spectral and temporal discrimination tasks. Cortical receptive fields are modeled as filters that change their spectro-temporal tuning properties so as to respond best to the discriminatory acoustic features between foreground and background stimuli. We also illustrate how biologically plausible constraints on the spectro-temporal tuning of the receptive fields can be used to optimize the plasticity. Results of the model simulations are compared to published data from a variety of experimental paradigms.},

Two-hundred and three were studied during iontophoretic administration of acetylcholine (ACh), 173 during administration of glutamate, and 24 during administration of atropine. 2. Fifty-six percent of the 218 neurons tested responded to somatic stimuli. Another 21\% did so during glutamate administration. In 11 cases ACh iontophoresis uncovered a receptive field in a previously unresponsive cell. 3. Forty-six percent of the 160 cells tested responded to thalamic stimulation. Another 17\% did so in the presence of glutamate, but 19 cells responded to neither cutaneous nor thalamic stimuli. 4. Sixteen percent of the 203 cells tested were overtly excited by ACh and the responses to somatic stimulation of 29\% were modulated by administration of ACh. Cells displaying overt excitation and/or modulation of responses were said to be cholinoceptive and made up 39\% of the sample. These cells were located in all cortical layers. 5. Cholinoceptive neurons were more likely than noncholinoceptive cells to be driven by thalamic stimulation. 6. The changes observed during ACh administration tended to be facilitatory: an enhanced responsiveness to somatic stimuli, an increased firing rate, or an increased receptive-field size. However, in 10 of the 203 cases tested one or more of these variables decreased. 7. The enhanced responsiveness during ACh administration was a robust phenomenon; responses were often increased by as much as 200\% and the discharge pattern was altered so that bursts of impulses following stimulation were more common. 8. ACh tended to enhance one attribute of a cell selectively rather than to act as a general excitant. 9. ACh is a powerful neuromodulatory agent in somatosensory cortex that, when released in specific behavioral states, should enhance the responsiveness of cortical neurons.},

  abstract      = {1. Two-hundred and seven neurons were examined for changes in their responsiveness during the iontophoretic administration of acetylcholine (ACh) in barbiturate-anesthetized cats. 2. The laminar locations of 78 cells were determined. Cholinoceptive neurons were found in all cortical layers and ranged from 50\% of the cells tested in layer I to 78\% in layer VI. 3. When the responsiveness of a neuron was measured by the magnitude of the discharge generated by a fixed dose of glutamate, 30 of 47 cases (64\%) were potentiated, and 4 (8\%) were depressed when ACh was administered during glutamate-induced excitation. 4. ACh administered during glutamate excitation was significantly more effective in altering neuronal responsiveness than was ACh administered alone (P less than 0.001). 5. When the responsiveness of a neuron was measured by the magnitude of the discharge generated by a standard somatic stimulus applied to the receptive field, 42 of 52 cases (81\%) were potentiated during ACh application. This was again different from ACh treatment alone where only 4 of 27 tests (15\%) resulted in subsequent enhancement of the response to somatic stimuli. 6. ACh generally increased the responsiveness of neurons with peripheral receptive fields and caused the appearance of a receptive field in some cells lacking one. 7. In many cases the changes in excitability, as measured by responses either to glutamate or to somatic stimulation, remained for prolonged time periods. When glutamate was used to test excitability, 34\% (16 of 47) of the enhancements lasted more than 5 min. When somatic stimuli were used 29\% (15 of 52) lasted more than 5 min. With both measures some neurons still displayed enhanced responses more than 1 h after the treatment with ACh. 8. ACh appears to act as a permissive agent that allows modification of the effectiveness with which previously existing afferent inputs drive somatosensory cortical neurons. 9. This mechanism to alter neuronal responsiveness has many of the characteristics necessary to account for the reorganization observed in somatosensory cortex following alterations in its afferent drive and may be related to some forms of learning and memory.},

Six different types of primary wind-sensitive interneurons in the cricket cercal sensory system were tested for their sensitivity to the orientation and peak velocity of unidirectional airflow stimuli. 2. The cells could be grouped into two distinct classes on the basis of their thresholds and static sensitivities to airflow velocity. 3. Four interneurons (the right and left 10-2 cells and the right and left 10-3 cells) made up one of the two distinct velocity sensitivity classes. The mean firing frequencies of these interneurons were proportional to the logarithm of peak stimulus velocity over the range from 0.02 to 2.0 cm/s. 4. The other two interneurons studied (left and right 9-3) had a higher air-current velocity threshold, near the saturation level of the 10-2 and 10-3 interneurons. The slope of the velocity sensitivity curve for the 9-3 interneurons was slightly greater than that for the 10-2 and 10-3 interneurons, extending the sensitivity range of the system as a whole to at least 100 cm/s. 5. All of the interneurons had broad, symmetrical, single-lobed directional sensitivity tuning curves that could be accurately represented as truncated sine waves with 360 degree period. 6. The four low-threshold interneurons (i.e., left and right 10-2 and 10-3) had peak directional sensitivities that were evenly spaced around the horizontal plane, and their overlapping tuning curves covered all possible air-current stimulus orientations. The variance in the cells' responses to identical repeated stimuli varied between approximately 10\% at the optimal stimulus orientations and approximately 30\% at the zero-crossing orientations. 7. The two higher threshold interneurons (left and right 9-3) had broader directional sensitivity curves and wider spacing, resulting in reduced overlap with respect to the low-threshold class.},

The task used two central cues, which predicted (80\% validity) when a subsequent target would occur (either 600 or 1400 ms after cue onset). Unlike previous tasks of attentional orienting, there was no spatial information provided and all stimuli were presented foveally. Reaction times and ERPs linked to targets presented at the shorter interval showed significant effects linked to attentional orienting. Reaction times were faster when the cues correctly predicted the cue-target interval, suggesting the ability of the brain to use information about time to deploy attentional resources. ERPs differed according to the predicted time interval. In particular, the P300 amplitude and latency were enhanced when the cue predicted the cue-target interval accurately. The ERPs elicited by the cues also differed according to the time interval that they predicted. Differences were observed in potentials linked to motor preparation and expectancies. The results reveal dynamic neural activity involved in orienting attention to time intervals, as well as the consequent modulation of target-related neural activity resulting from differing temporal expectations.},

We recorded neurons in area V4 as monkeys performed an attention-demanding task. We find that the distribution of action potential durations is strongly bimodal. Neurons with narrow action potentials have higher firing rates and larger attention-dependent increases in absolute firing rate than neurons with broad action potentials. The percentage increase in response is similar across the two classes. We also find evidence that attention increases the reliability of the neuronal response. This modulation is more than two-fold stronger among putative interneurons. These findings lead to the surprising conclusion that the strongest attentional modulation occurs among local interneurons that do not transmit signals between areas.},

In this context, visual distracters constitute an external source of noise that is diminished to improve attended signal quality. Activity that is internal to the cortex itself, stimulus-independent ongoing correlated fluctuations in firing, might also act as task-irrelevant noise. To examine this, we recorded from area V4 of macaques performing an attention-demanding task. The firing of neurons to identically repeated stimuli was highly variable. Much of this variability originates from ongoing low-frequency (<5 Hz) fluctuations in rate correlated across the neuronal population. When attention is directed to a stimulus inside a neuron's receptive field, these correlated fluctuations in rate are reduced. This attention-dependent reduction of ongoing cortical activity improves the signal-to-noise ratio of pooled neural signals substantially more than attention-dependent increases in firing rate.},

  abstract      = {To study the roles of the perirhinal cortex (PRh) and temporal cortex (area TE) in stimulus-reward associations, we recorded spike activities of cells from PRh and TE in two monkeys performing a visually cued go/no-go task. Each visual cue indicated the required motor action as well as the availability of reward after correct completion of the trial. Eighty object images were divided into four groups, each of which was assigned to one of four motor-reward conditions. The monkeys either had to release a lever (go response) or keep pressing it (no-go response), depending on the cue. Each of the go and no-go trials could be either a rewarded or unrewarded trial. A liquid reward was provided after correct responses in rewarded trials, whereas correct responses were acknowledged only by audiovisual feedback in unrewarded trials. Several measures of the monkeys' behavior indicated that the monkeys correctly anticipated the reward availability in each trial. The dependence of neuronal activity on the reward condition was examined by comparing mean discharges to each of the 40 rewarded stimuli with those to each of the 40 unrewarded stimuli. Many cells in both areas showed significant reward dependence in their responses to the visual cues, and this was not likely attributable to differences in behavior across conditions because the variations in neuronal activity were not correlated with trial-by-trial variations in latency of go responses or anticipatory sucking strength. These results suggest the involvement of PRh and TE in associating visual stimuli with reward outcomes.},

We present a model for how such errors could be constructed in a real brain that is consistent with physiological results for a subset of dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area and surrounding dopaminergic neurons. The theory also makes testable predictions about human choice behavior on a simple decision-making task. Furthermore, we show that, through a simple influence on synaptic plasticity, fluctuations in dopamine release can act to change the predictions in an appropriate manner.},

  abstract      = {The spiking activity of nearby cortical neurons is not independent. Numerous studies have explored the importance of this correlated responsivity for visual coding and perception, often by comparing the information conveyed by pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons with the sum of information provided by the respective individual cells. Pairwise responses typically provide slightly more information so that encoding is weakly synergistic. The simple comparison between pairwise and summed individual responses conflates several forms of correlation, however, making it impossible to judge the relative importance of synchronous spiking, basic tuning properties, and stimulus-independent and stimulus-dependent correlation. We have applied an information theoretic approach to this question, using the responses of pairs of neurons to drifting sinusoidal gratings of different directions and contrasts that have been recorded in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaque monkeys. Our approach allows us to break down the information provided by pairs of neurons into a number of components. This analysis reveals that, although synchrony is prevalent and informative, the additional information it provides frequently is offset by the redundancy arising from the similar tuning properties of the two cells. Thus coding is approximately independent with weak synergy or redundancy arising, depending on the similarity in tuning and the temporal precision of the analysis. We suggest that this would allow cortical circuits to enjoy the stability provided by having similarly tuned neurons without suffering the penalty of redundancy, because the associated information transmission deficit is compensated for by stimulus-dependent synchrony.},

  abstract      = {Songbirds learn and maintain their songs via auditory experience. Neurons in many telencephalic nuclei important to song production and development are song selective, firing more to forward auditory playback of the bird's own song (BOS) than to reverse BOS or conspecific songs. Elucidating circuits that generate these responses can localize where auditory experience influences vocalization, bridging cellular and systems analyses of song learning. Song-selective responses in many song nuclei, including the vocal premotor nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA) and the basal ganglia homolog area X, are thought to originate in nucleus HVc (used as a proper name), which contains interneurons and relay cells that innervate either RA or area X. Previous studies indicated that only X-projecting neurons have auditory responses, leaving open the source of RA's auditory input and the degree to which song selectivity may be refined in HVc. Here, in vivo intracellular recordings from morphologically and electrophysiologically identified HVc neurons revealed that both relay cell types fire song-selectively. However, their firing arises via markedly different subthreshold processes, and only X-projecting neurons appear to be sites for auditory refinement. RA-projecting neurons exhibited purely depolarizing subthreshold responses that were highly song selective and that were excitatory. In contrast, subthreshold responses of X-projecting neurons included less-selective depolarizing and highly selective hyperpolarizing components. Within individual birds, these BOS-evoked hyperpolarizations closely matched interneuronal firing, suggesting that HVc interneurons make restricted inputs onto X-projecting neurons. Because of the two relay cell types' subthreshold differences, factors affecting their resting membrane potentials could enable them to transmit distinct song representations to their targets.},

Although invariant neural responses, such as rotation-invariant face cells, are well described in the visual system, high-level auditory neurons that can represent the same behaviorally relevant signal in a range of listening conditions have yet to be discovered. Here we found neurons in a secondary area of the avian auditory cortex that exhibit noise-invariant responses in the sense that they responded with similar spike patterns to song stimuli presented in silence and over a background of naturalistic noise. By characterizing the neurons' tuning in terms of their responses to modulations in the temporal and spectral envelope of the sound, we then show that noise invariance is partly achieved by selectively responding to long sounds with sharp spectral structure. Finally, to demonstrate that such computations could explain noise invariance, we designed a biologically inspired noise-filtering algorithm that can be used to separate song or speech from noise. This novel noise-filtering method performs as well as other state-of-the-art de-noising algorithms and could be used in clinical or consumer oriented applications. Our biologically inspired model also shows how high-level noise-invariant responses could be created from neural responses typically found in primary auditory cortex.},

  abstract      = {The responses of primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons to pure tones in anesthetized animals are usually described as having mostly narrow, unimodal frequency tuning and phasic responses. Thus A1 neurons are believed not to carry much information about pure tones beyond sound onset. In awake cats, however, tuning may be wider and responses may have substantially longer duration. Here we analyze frequency-response areas (FRAs) and temporal-response patterns of 1,828 units in A1 of halothane-anesthetized cats. Tuning was generally wide: the total bandwidth at 40 dB above threshold was 4 octaves on average. FRA shapes were highly variable and many were diffuse, not fitting into standard classification schemes. Analyzing the temporal patterns of the largest responses of each unit revealed that only 9\% of the units had pure onset responses. About 40\% of the units had sustained responses throughout stimulus duration (115 ms) and 13\% of the units had significant and informative responses lasting 300 ms and more after stimulus offset. We conclude that under halothane anesthesia, neural responses show many of the characteristics of awake responses. Furthermore, A1 units maintain sensory information in their activity not only throughout sound presentation but also for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus offset, thus possibly playing a role in sensory memory.},

The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

Here, we demonstrate a neurophysiological correlate of efficient visual search through highly familiar object arrays. Humans and monkeys are faster at locating the same target when it is surrounded by familiar compared with unfamiliar distractors. We show that this behavioral enhancement is driven by an increased sensitivity of target-selective neurons in inferior temporal cortex. This results from an increased ``signal'' for target representations and decreased ``noise'' from neighboring familiar distractors. These data highlight the dynamic properties of the inferior temporal cortex neurons and add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating how experience shapes neural processing in the ventral visual stream.},

  abstract      = {The speed and accuracy of odor recognition in insects can hardly be resolved by the raw descriptors provided by olfactory receptors alone due to their slow time constant and high variability. The animal overcomes these barriers by means of the antennal lobe (AL) dynamics, which consolidates the classificatory information in receptor signal with a spatiotemporal code that is enriched in odor sensitivity, particularly in its transient. Inspired by this fact, we propose an easily implementable AL-like network and show that it significantly expedites and enhances the identification of odors from slow and noisy artificial polymer sensor responses. The device owes its efficiency to two intrinsic mechanisms: inhibition (which triggers a competition) and integration (due to the dynamical nature of the network). The former functions as a sharpening filter extracting the features of receptor signal that favor odor separation, whereas the latter implements a working memory by accumulating the extracted features in trajectories. This cooperation boosts the odor specificity during the receptor transient, which is essential for fast odor recognition.},

Of all the auditory neurons, 16.8\% did not respond to pure tones but only to more complex stimuli (tone-unresponsive-, TU-units). The remaining auditory units were classified as tone-responsive (TR-units). In 44.3\% of TR-units (i.e. 36.9\% of all auditory units) differing responses to tones versus more complex stimuli were observed. Responses as they occur in TU-units and in the differing responses of TR-units can be explained by neuronal extraction of features in the time (108 out of 198 neurons) and in the spectral domain (82 out of 198 neurons). Responses to species-specific sounds usually can be explained in terms of extraction of these features. Among neurons sensitive to temporal features, exclusive responses to a narrow range of AM frequencies were observed. In those TU-units that represent spectral features some restrict their responses to noise bands with distinct bandwidths centered around a specific midfrequency. These units reject both wider and narrower noise bands. A tonotopic arrangement of auditory units is found in field L, the surrounding neostriatum (NCM), and the Hyperstriatum ventrale (HV). Isofrequency lines run as a continuum through NCM, field L, and the caudal part of HV. TU-units are integrated into the tonotopic gradient according to the midfrequency of effective stimuli (e.g. noise bands or AM). The anatomical position of auditory units is correlated to their response properties. Within one isofrequency contour an increase in response selectivity is seen from field L to the postsynaptic areas in the NCM and the HV. The results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of feature extraction in the avian auditory system.},

We now ask whether fine acoustic information, which is not retained at high levels, can still be used to extract speech from noise. Previous theories suggested either full availability of low-level information or availability that is limited by task difficulty. We propose a third alternative, based on the Reverse Hierarchy Theory (RHT), originally derived to describe the relations between the processing hierarchy and visual perception. RHT asserts that only the higher levels of the hierarchy are immediately available for perception. Direct access to low-level information requires specific conditions, and can be achieved only at the cost of concurrent comprehension. We tested the predictions of these three views in a series of experiments in which we measured the benefits from utilizing low-level binaural information for speech perception, and compared it to that predicted from a model of the early auditory system.

  abstract      = {We examined the impact of variability in speech stimuli on improvement of general performance and on accessibility to low-level information as a function of practice. Listeners had to discriminate between two similar words in noise in two configurations that differed only in their low-level binaural information, which was either null or maximal. The difference in performance quantifies the use of binaural low-level information. These configurations were presented in three training protocols: in separate blocks; in a consistently interleaved manner; and in a randomly mixed manner. The first protocol enabled optimal use of the low-level binaural cues already at the first training session. The second, consistently interleaved protocol required more than one training session to reach the same performance. The final, mixed protocol did not enable optimal use of the low-level cues even after multi-session training. Interestingly, training with the first two protocols transferred to the mixed one. These results are in line with recent findings in the visual modality. In both modalities, the effects of variability on learning can be explained by the introduction of obstructions to a search mechanism going down along the sensory processing hierarchy, as suggested by the Reverse Hierarchy Theory.},

Controlling for this complexity demonstrates speech-specific processing lateralized to the left temporal lobe, and our recent positron emission tomography study has emphasized a role for left anterolateral temporal cortex in speech comprehension. This contrasts with the more usual view that relates speech comprehension to left temporal-parietal cortex, the ill-defined area of Wernicke. This study attempted to reconcile these differences, using a more sensitive 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging system, and a sparse sampling paradigm. We found left lateralized activations for intelligible speech with two distinct foci, one in the anterior superior temporal sulcus and the other on the posterior temporal lobe. Therefore, the results demonstrate that there are neural responses to intelligible speech along the length of the left lateral temporal neocortex, although the precise processing roles of the anterior and posterior regions cannot be determined from this study.},

For instance, some neurons lie in regions of fairly homogeneous orientation preference (iso-orientation domains), while others lie in regions with a variety of preferences (e.g., pinwheel centers). We asked whether this diversity in local map structure correlates with the degree of selectivity of spike responses. We used a combination of imaging and electrophysiology to reveal that neurons in regions of homogeneous orientation preference have much sharper tuning. Moreover, in both monkeys and cats, a common principle links the structure of the orientation map, on the spatial scale of dendritic integration, to the degree of selectivity of individual cells. We conclude that neural computation is not invariant across the cortical surface. This finding must factor into future theories of receptive field wiring and map development.},

To study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from multi-electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. Spikes at each location generated outward traveling LFP waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these LFP waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: LFP traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a approximately 1.5-mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. Lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial.},

Testing these predictions requires the development of new methods that allow the recording of single units at various locations across the orientation map. Here we present a novel technique for the precise alignment of functional maps and array recordings. Our strategy consists of first measuring the orientation maps in V1 using intrinsic optical imaging. A micromachined electrode array is subsequently implanted in the same patch of cortex for electrophysiological recordings, including the measurement of orientation tuning curves. The location of the array within the map is obtained by finding the position that maximizes the agreement between the preferred orientations measured electrically and optically. Experimental results of the alignment procedure from two implementations in monkey V1 are presented. The estimated accuracy of the procedure is evaluated using computer simulations. The methodology should prove useful in studying how signals from the local neighborhood of a neuron, thought to provide a dominant feedback signal, shape the receptive field properties in V1.},

During 24 months of incubation, the rate of AOM (measured as methane-dependent sulfide formation) increased from 20 to 230 micromol day(-1) (g sediment dry weight)(-1) and the number of aggregates (determined by microscopic counts) from 0.5 x 10(8) to 5.7 x 10(8) (g sediment dry weight)(-1). Fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting 16S rRNA of both partners showed that the newly grown consortia contained central archaeal clusters and peripheral bacterial layers, both with the same morphology and phylogenetic affiliation as in the original sediment. The development of the AOM rate and the total consortia biovolume over time indicated that the consortia grew with a doubling time of approximately 7 months (growth rate 0.003 day(-1)) under the given conditions. The molar growth yield of AOM was approximately 0.6 g cell dry weight (mol CH(4) oxidized)(-1); according to this, only 1\% of the consumed methane is channelled into synthesis of consortia biomass. Concentrations of biomarker lipids previously attributed to ANME-2 archaea (e.g. sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol, archaeol, crocetane, pentamethylicosatriene) and Desulfosarcina-like bacteria [e.g. hexadecenoic-11 acid (16:1omega5c), 11,12-methylene-hexadecanoic acid (cy17:0omega5,6)] strongly increased over time (some of them over-proportionally to consortia biovolume), suggesting that they are useful biomarkers to detect active anaerobic methanotrophic consortia in sediments.},

  abstract      = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulphate reduction were examined in sediment samples from a marine gas hydrate area (Hydrate Ridge, NE Pacific). The sediment contained high numbers of microbial consortia consisting of organisms that affiliate with methanogenic archaea and with sulphate-reducing bacteria. Sediment samples incubated under strictly anoxic conditions in defined mineral medium (salinity as in seawater) produced sulphide from sulphate if methane was added as the sole organic substrate. No sulphide production occurred in control experiments without methane. Methane-dependent sulphide production was fastest between 4 degree C and 16 degree C, the average rate with 0.1 MPa (approximately 1 atm) methane being 2.5 micro mol sulphide day(-1) and (g dry mass sediment)(-1). An increase of the methane pressure to 1.1 MPa (approximately 11 atm) resulted in a four to fivefold increase of the sulphide production rate. Quantitative measurements using a special anoxic incubation device without gas phase revealed continuous consumption of dissolved methane (from initially 3.2 to 0.7 mM) with simultaneous production of sulphide at a molar ratio of nearly 1:1. To test the response of the indigenous community to possible intermediates of AOM, molecular hydrogen, formate, acetate or methanol were added in the absence of methane; however, sulphide production from sulphate with any of these compounds was much slower than with methane. In the presence of methane, such additions neither stimulated nor inhibited sulphate reduction. Hence, the experiments did not provide evidence for one of these compounds acting as a free extracellular intermediate (intercellular shuttle) during AOM by the presently investigated consortia.},

  abstract      = {1,3-Butadiene (BD) is used in the production of synthetic rubber and other resins. Carcinogenic effects have been observed in laboratory animals exposed to BD, with mice being more sensitive than rats. Metabolic oxidation of butadiene to epoxides is believed to be a crucial step in the initiation of tumors by BD. However, limited information is available that describes the in vivo metabolism of BD. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 800 ppm [1,2 3,4-13C]butadiene for 5 h, and urine was collected during and for 20 h following exposure. Urinary metabolites were characterized using 1- and 2-dimensional methods of NMR spectroscopy. Three metabolites previously detected in vivo, N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxy-3-butenyl)-L-cysteine, N-acetyl-S-(1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-propenyl)-L-cysteine, and N-acetyl-S-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-L-cysteine, were present in both rat and mouse urine, accounting for 87\% and 73\% of the total metabolites excreted, respectively. A fourth metabolite, previously detected in vitro, 3-butene-1,2-diol, was also present in both rat and mouse urine and comprised 5\% and 3\% of the total metabolites excreted, respectively. An additional metabolite detected only in mouse urine that is derived from glutathione conjugation with epoxybutene was identified as S-(1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-propenyl)-L-cysteine (4\%). N-Acetyl-S-(1-hydroxy-3-butenyl)-L-cysteine (4\%), detected in mouse urine, is a thiohemiacetal product of 3-butenal. Additionally, mice excreted N-acetyl-S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-L-cysteine (5\%) and N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine (5\%), which could be derived from further metabolism of N-acetyl-S-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-L-cysteine or from glutathione conjugation with acrolein. Mice excreted N-acetyl-S-(1-(hydroxymethyl)-3,4-dihydroxypropyl)-L-cysteine (5\%), which could be derived from glutathione conjugation with diepoxybutane (BDE), while rats excreted 1,3-dihydroxypropanone (5\%), which may be derived from hydrolysis of BDE. These studies indicate that reactive aldehydes are produced as metabolites of BD in vivo, in addition to the reactive monoepoxide and diepoxide of BD. The greater toxicity of BD in mice compared with rats may be attributed to the greater ability of rats to detoxify BDE via hydrolysis, and/or to the production of reactive aldehydes.},

  abstract      = {A long debate in selective attention research is whether attention enhances sensory response or sharpens neural tuning by suppressing response to non-target input. In fact, both processes may occur as a function of load: an uncertain listener might use a broad attentional filter to enhance responses to all inputs (i.e., vigilance), yet employ sharpened tuning to focus on hard to discriminate targets. The present work used the greater signal gain, anatomical precision, and laterality separation of intracranial electrophysiological recordings (electrocorticograms) to investigate these competing effects. Data were recorded from acoustically-responsive cortex in the perisylvian region of a single hemisphere in five neurosurgery patients. Patients performed a dichotic listening task in which they alternately attended toward, away from, or completely ignored (silent reading) tones presented to designated ears at varying presentation rates. Comparisons between the grand-averaged event-related potential (ERP) waveforms show a striking change in the effect of selective auditory attention with attentional load. At slower presentation rates (low-load), ERPs were overall enhanced in response to both input channels and regardless of attended ear, including a significant enhancement of ipsilateral input. This result supports a broadly enhancing model of attention under low perceptual load conditions. At the fastest rate, however, only responses to attended inputs contralateral to grid location remained enhanced. This result supports an increasing suppression, or ``sharpening,'' of neural responses to non-targets with increasing attentional load. These data provide support for an elastic model of attention in which attentional scope narrows with increasing load.},

  abstract      = {Sounds are encoded into electrical activity in the inner ear, where they are represented (roughly) as patterns of energy in narrow frequency bands. However, sounds are perceived in terms of their high-order properties. It is generally believed that this transformation is performed along the auditory hierarchy, with low-level physical cues computed at early stages of the auditory system and high-level abstract qualities at high-order cortical areas. The functional position of primary auditory cortex (A1) in this scheme is unclear - is it 'early', encoding physical cues, or is it 'late', already encoding abstract qualities? Here we argue that neurons in cat A1 show sensitivity to high-level features of sounds. In particular, these neurons may already show sensitivity to 'auditory objects'. The evidence for this claim comes from studies in which individual sounds are presented singly and in mixtures. Many neurons in cat A1 respond to mixtures in the same way they respond to one of the individual components of the mixture, and in many cases neurons may respond to a low-level component of the mixture rather than to the acoustically dominant one, even though the same neurons respond to the acoustically-dominant component when presented alone.},

  abstract      = {We used optical imaging of intrinsic signals to study the large-scale organization of ferret auditory cortex in response to complex sounds. Cortical responses were collected during continuous stimulation by sequences of sounds with varying frequency, period, or interaural level differences. We used a set of stimuli that differ in spectral structure, but have the same periodicity and therefore evoke the same pitch percept (click trains, sinusoidally amplitude modulated tones, and iterated ripple noise). These stimuli failed to reveal a consistent periodotopic map across the auditory fields imaged. Rather, gradients of period sensitivity differed for the different types of periodic stimuli. Binaural interactions were studied both with single contralateral, ipsilateral, and diotic broadband noise bursts and with sequences of broadband noise bursts with varying level presented contralaterally, ipsilaterally, or in opposite phase to both ears. Contralateral responses were generally largest and ipsilateral responses were smallest when using single noise bursts, but the extent of the activated area was large and comparable in all three aural configurations. Modulating the amplitude in counter phase to the two ears generally produced weaker modulation of the optical signals than the modulation produced by the monaural stimuli. These results suggest that binaural interactions seen in cortex are most likely predominantly due to subcortical processing. Thus our optical imaging data do not support the theory that the primary or nonprimary cortical fields imaged are topographically organized to form consistent maps of systematically varying sensitivity either to stimulus pitch or to simple binaural properties of the acoustic stimuli.},

Optical responses were collected during continuous stimulation by repeated sequences of sounds with varying frequency. The optical signal was averaged as a function of time during the sequence, to produce reflectance modulation functions (RMFs). We examined the stability and properties of the RMFs and show that their zero-crossing points provide the best temporal reference points for quantifying the relationship between the stimulus parameter values and optical responses. Sequences of different duration and direction of frequency change gave rise to comparable results, although in some cases discrepancies were observed, mostly between upward- and downward-frequency sequences. We demonstrated frequency maps, consistent with previous data, in primary auditory cortex and in the anterior auditory field, which were verified with electrophysiological recordings. In addition to these tonotopic gradients, we demonstrated at least 2 new acoustically responsive areas on the anterior and posterior ectosylvian gyri, which have not previously been described. Although responsive to pure tones, these areas exhibit less tonotopic order than the primary fields.},

Identifying which aspects of the neural responses actually encode sensory information remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. Here we compared various approaches for estimating the information transmitted by neurons in auditory cortex in two very different experimental paradigms, one measuring spatial tuning and the other responses to complex natural stimuli. We demonstrate that, in both cases, spike counts and mean response times jointly carry essentially all the available information about the stimuli. Thus, in auditory cortex, whereas spike counts carry only partial information about stimulus identity or location, the additional availability of relatively coarse temporal information is sufficient in order to extract essentially all the sensory information available in the spike discharge pattern, at least for the relatively short stimuli (<approximately 100 ms) commonly used in auditory research.},

  abstract      = {Neurons in sensory cortices are often assumed to be ``feature detectors'', computing simple and then successively more complex features out of the incoming sensory stream. These features are somehow integrated into percepts. Despite many years of research, a convincing candidate for such a feature in primary auditory cortex has not been found. We argue that feature detection is actually a secondary issue in understanding the role of primary auditory cortex. Instead, the major contribution of primary auditory cortex to auditory perception is in processing previously derived features on a number of different timescales. We hypothesize that, as a result, neurons in primary auditory cortex represent sounds in terms of auditory objects rather than in terms of feature maps. According to this hypothesis, primary auditory cortex has a pivotal role in the auditory system in that it generates the representation of auditory objects to which higher auditory centers assign properties such as spatial location, source identity, and meaning.},

We characterized these connections physiologically with cross-correlograms (CCHs), calculated for neuron pairs or small groups located one each in visual areas 17 and 18 of the cat. The CCHs were then compared to the visuotopic and orientation match of the neurons' receptive fields (RFs). For both spontaneous and visually driven activity, most non-flat correlograms were centered; i.e. the most likely temporal relationship between spikes in the two areas is a synchronous one. Although spikes are most likely to occur simultaneously, area 17 spikes may occur before area 18 or vice versa, giving the cross-correlogram peak a finite width (temporal dispersion). Cross-correlograms fell into one of three groups according to their full-width at half peak height: 1-8 ms (modal width, 3 ms), 15-65 ms (modal width 30 ms), or 100-1000 ms (modal width 400 ms). These classificatory groups are nonoverlapping; the three types of coupling appeared singly and in combination. Neurons whose receptive fields (RFs) are nonoverlapping or cross-oriented may yet be coupled, but the coupling is more likely to be the broadest type of coupling than the medium-dispersed type. The sharpest type of coupling is found exclusively between neurons with at least partially overlapping RFs and mostly between neurons whose stimulus orientation preferences matched to within 22.5 deg. The maximum spatial dispersion observed in the RFs of coupled neurons compares well with the maximum divergence seen anatomically in the A18/A17 projection system. We suggest three different mechanisms to produce each of the three different degrees of observed spatial and temporal coherence. All mechanisms use common input of cortical origin. For medium and broad coupling, this common input arises from cell assemblies split between both sides of the 17/18 projection system, but acting synchronously. Such distributed common-input cell assemblies are a means of overcoming sparse connectivity and achieving synaptic transmission in the pyramidal network.},

STUDY DESIGN: An initial study of 613 cases (set A) was conducted to compare the TriPath PREP system with conventional methods for the evaluation of nongynecologic specimens, including urine, body cavity effusions, cerebrospinal fluid, pulmonary and gastrointestinal specimens. Paired cases were evaluated for cellularity, staining quality, preservation and representation of diagnostic material. Subsequent changes in the automated technique warranted reevaluation of the TriPath method. The follow-up study of 259 cases (set B) was conducted with the same design as set A. Results of evaluated parameters were analyzed using the chi 2 test. RESULTS: Results of the two sets were strikingly different. Prior to technical changes made by the laboratory, the TriPath method was significantly inferior. In the second set, the preferred material was most commonly the TriPath-prepared material. In particular, the majority of urine samples were prepared better by the automated, thin-layer system. CONCLUSION: The TriPath PREP system offers a reliable preparation of urine and has potential for other nongynecologic specimens, provided that careful attention is paid to technical details and some adjustments are made to account for specimen variability.},

  abstract      = {How single neurons represent information about the magnitude of a stimulus remains controversial. Neurons encoding purely sensory magnitude typically show monotonic response functions (``summation coding''), and summation units are usually implemented in models of numerosity representation. In contrast, cells representing numerical quantity exhibit nonmonotonic tuning functions that peak at their preferred numerosity (``labeled-line code''), but the restricted range of tested quantities in these studies did not permit a definite answer. Here, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of a broad range of numerosities from 1 to 30 in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys. Numerosity-selective neurons showed a clear and behaviorally relevant labeled-line code for all numerosities. Moreover, both the behavioral and neuronal tuning functions obeyed the Weber-Fechner Law and were best represented on a nonlinearly compressed scale. Our single-cell study is in good agreement with functional imaging data reporting peaked tuning functions in humans, demonstrating neuronal precursors for human number competence in a nonhuman primate. Our findings also emphasize that the manner in which neurons encode and maintain magnitude information may depend on the precise task at hand as well as the type of magnitude to represent and memorize.},

If cognitive processes parallel perceptual processes, then fundamental psychophysical laws should hold for each. To test this, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. The data were best described by a nonlinearly compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber-Fechner law or Stevens' law for psychophysical/sensory magnitudes. This nonlinear compression was observed on the neural level during the acquisition phase of the task and maintained through the memory phase with no further compression. These results suggest that certain cognitive and perceptual/sensory representations share the same fundamental mechanisms and neural coding schemes.},

The importance of this correlated firing for encoding visual information is unclear and controversial. Here we examine its importance in the retina. We present the retina with natural stimuli and record the responses of its output cells, the ganglion cells. We then use information theoretic techniques to measure the amount of information about the stimuli that can be obtained from the cells under two conditions: when their correlated firing is taken into account, and when their correlated firing is ignored. We find that more than 90\% of the information about the stimuli can be obtained from the cells when their correlated firing is ignored. This indicates that ganglion cells act largely independently to encode information, which greatly simplifies the problem of decoding their activity.},

We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural system involved in directing attention to locations in arrays held as mental representations, and to compare it with the system for directing spatial attention to locations in the external world. We found that these two crucial aspects of spatial cognition are subserved by extensively overlapping networks. However, we also found that a region of right parietal cortex selectively participated in orienting attention to the extrapersonal space, whereas several frontal lobe regions selectively participated in orienting attention within on-line mental representations.},

  abstract      = {We have traced central nervous pathways controlling bird song in the canary using a combination of behavioral and anatomical techniques. Unilateral electrolytic brain lesions were made in adult male canaries whose song had been previously recorded and analysed on a sound spectrograph. After several days of postoperative recording, the birds were sacrificed and their brains processed histologically for degeneration staining with the Fink-Heimer technique. Although large lesions in the neostriatum and rostral hyperstriatum had no effect on song, severe song deficits followed damage to a discrete large-celled area in the caudal hyperstriatum ventrale (HVc). Degenerating fibers were traced from this region to two other discrete nuclei in the forebrain: one in the parolfactory lobe (area X, a teardrop-shaped small-celled nucleus); and a round large-celled nucleus in the archistriatum (RA). Unilateral lesion of X had no effect on song; lesions of RA, however, caused severe song deficits. Degenerating fibers from RA joined the occipitomesencephalic tract and had widespread ipsilateral projections to the thalamus, nucleus intercollicularis of the midbrain, reticular formation, and medulla. It is of particular interest that direct connections were found onto the cells of the motor nucleus innervating the syrinx, the organ of song production. Unilateral lesions of n. intercollicularis (previously implicated in the control of vocal behavior) had little effect on song. One bilateral lesion of HVc resulted in permanent (9 months) and complete elimination of the audible components of song, although the bird assumed the posture and movements typical of song. Preliminary data suggest that lesions of the left hemisphere result in greater deficits than lesions of the right one. This finding is consistent with earlier reports that the left syrinx controls the majority of song components. Results reported here suggest a localization of vocal control in the canary brain with an overlying left hemispheric dominance.},

  abstract      = {To facilitate the characterization of cortical neuronal function, the responses of cells in cat area 17 to intracellular injection of current pulses were quantitatively analyzed. A variety of response variables were used to separate the cells into subtypes using cluster analysis. Four main classes of neurons could be clearly distinguished: regular spiking (RS), fast spiking (FS), intrinsic bursting (IB), and chattering (CH). Each of these contained significant subclasses. RS neurons were characterized by trains of action potentials that exhibited spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these cells were spiny stellate cells in layer 4 and pyramidal cells in layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. FS neurons had short-duration action potentials (<0.5 ms at half height), little or no spike frequency adaptation, and a steep relationship between injected current intensity and spike discharge frequency. Morphologically, these cells were sparsely spiny or aspiny nonpyramidal cells. IB neurons typically generated a low frequency (<425 Hz) burst of spikes at the beginning of a depolarizing current pulse followed by a tonic train of action potentials for the remainder of the pulse. These cells were observed in all cortical layers, but were most abundant in layer 5. Finally, CH neurons generated repetitive, high-frequency (350-700 Hz) bursts of short-duration (<0.55 ms) action potentials. Morphologically, these cells were layer 2-4 (mainly layer 3) pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons. These results indicate that firing properties do not form a continuum and that cortical neurons are members of distinct electrophysiological classes and subclasses.},

  abstract      = {Cross-correlation studies performed in cat visual cortex have shown that neurons in different cortical areas of the same hemisphere or in corresponding areas of opposite hemispheres tend to synchronize their activities. The presence of synchronization may be related to the parallel organization of the cat visual system, in which different cortical areas can be activated in parallel from the lateral geniculate nucleus. We wanted to determine whether interareal synchronization of firing can also be observed in the monkey, in which cortical areas are thought to be organized in a hierarchy spanning different levels. Cross-correlation histograms (CCHs) were calculated from pairs of single or pairs of multiunit activities simultaneously recorded in areas V1 and V2 of paralyzed and anesthetized macaque monkeys. Moving bars and flashed bars were used as stimuli. The shift predictor was calculated and subtracted from the raw CCH to reveal interactions of neuronal origin in isolation. Significant CCH peaks, indicating interactions of neuronal origin, were obtained in 11\% of the dual single-unit recordings and 46\% of the dual multiunit recordings with moving bars. The incidence of nonflat CCHs with flashed bars was 29 and 78\%, respectively. For the pairs of recording sites where both flashed and moving stimuli were used, the incidences of significant CCHs were very similar. Three types of peaks were distinguished on the basis of their width at half-height: T (<16 ms), C (between 16 and 180 ms), and H peaks (>180 ms). T peaks were very rarely observed (<1\% in single-unit recordings). H peaks were observed in 7-16\% of the single-unit CCHs, and C peaks in 6-16\%, depending on the stimulus used. C and H peaks were observed more often when the receptive fields were overlapping or distant by <2 degrees. To test for the presence of synchronization between neurons in areas V1 and V2, we measured the position of the CCH peak with respect to the origin of the time axis of the CCH. Only in the case of a few T peaks did we find displaced peaks, indicating a possible drive of the V2 neuron by the simultaneously recorded V1 cell. All the other peaks were either centered on the origin or overlapped the origin of time with their upper halves. Thus similarly to what has been reported for the cat, neurons belonging to different cortical areas in the monkey tend to synchronize the time of emission of their action potentials with three different levels of temporal precision. For peaks calculated from flashed stimuli, we compared the peak position with the difference between latencies of V1 and V2 neurons. There was a clear correlation for single-unit pairs in the case of C peaks. Thus the position of a C peak on the time axis appears to reflect the order of visual activation of the correlated neurons. The coupling strength for H peaks was smaller during visual drive compared with spontaneous activity. On the contrary, C peaks were seen more often and were stronger during visual stimulation than during spontaneous activity. This suggests that C-type synchronization is associated with the processing of visual information. The origin of synchronized activity in a serially organized system is discussed.},

  abstract      = {This study was undertaken to document plastic changes in the functional topography of primary motor cortex (M1) that are generated in motor skill learning in the normal, intact primate. Intracortical microstimulation mapping techniques were used to derive detailed maps of the representation of movements in the distal forelimb zone of M1 of squirrel monkeys, before and after behavioral training on two different tasks that differentially encouraged specific sets of forelimb movements. After training on a small-object retrieval task, which required skilled use of the digits, their evoked-movement digit representations expanded, whereas their evoked-movement wrist/forearm representational zones contracted. These changes were progressive and reversible. In a second motor skill exercise, a monkey pronated and supinated the forearm in a key (eyebolt)-turning task. In this case, the representation of the forearm expanded, whereas the digit representational zones contracted. These results show that M1 is alterable by use throughout the life of an animal. These studies also revealed that after digit training there was an areal expansion of dual-response representations, that is, cortical sectors over which stimulation produced movements about two or more joints. Movement combinations that were used more frequently after training were selectively magnified in their cortical representations. This close correspondence between changes in behavioral performance and electrophysiologically defined motor representations indicates that a neurophysiological correlate of a motor skill resides in M1 for at least several days after acquisition. The finding that cocontracting muscles in the behavior come to be represented together in the cortex argues that, as in sensory cortices, temporal correlations drive emergent changes in distributed motor cortex representations.},

  abstract      = {Recent electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that attending to sounds increases the response selectivity of neuronal ensembles even at the first cortical stage of auditory stimulus processing in primary auditory cortex (A1). This is achieved by enhancement of responses in the regions that process attended frequency content, and by suppression of responses in the surrounding regions. The goals of our study were to define the extent to which A1 neuronal ensembles are involved in this process, determine its effect on the frequency tuning of A1 neuronal ensembles, and examine the involvement of the different cortical layers. To accomplish these, we analyzed laminar profiles of synaptic activity and action potentials recorded in A1 of macaques performing a rhythmic intermodal selective attention task. We found that the frequency tuning of neuronal ensembles was sharpened due to both increased gain at the preferentially processed or best frequency and increased response suppression at all other frequencies when auditory stimuli were attended. Our results suggest that these effects are due to a frequency-specific counterphase entrainment of ongoing delta oscillations, which predictively orchestrates opposite sign excitability changes across all of A1. This results in a net suppressive effect due to the large proportion of neuronal ensembles that do not specifically process the attended frequency content. Furthermore, analysis of laminar activation profiles revealed that although attention-related suppressive effects predominate the responses of supragranular neuronal ensembles, response enhancement is dominant in the granular and infragranular layers, providing evidence for layer-specific cortical operations in attentive stimulus processing.},

  abstract      = {How humans solve the cocktail party problem remains unknown. However, progress has been made recently thanks to the realization that cortical activity tracks the amplitude envelope of speech. This has led to the development of regression methods for studying the neurophysiology of continuous speech. One such method, known as stimulus-reconstruction, has been successfully utilized with cortical surface recordings and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the former is invasive and gives a relatively restricted view of processing along the auditory hierarchy, whereas the latter is expensive and rare. Thus it would be extremely useful for research in many populations if stimulus-reconstruction was effective using electroencephalography (EEG), a widely available and inexpensive technology. Here we show that single-trial ( approximately 60 s) unaveraged EEG data can be decoded to determine attentional selection in a naturalistic multispeaker environment. Furthermore, we show a significant correlation between our EEG-based measure of attention and performance on a high-level attention task. In addition, by attempting to decode attention at individual latencies, we identify neural processing at approximately 200 ms as being critical for solving the cocktail party problem. These findings open up new avenues for studying the ongoing dynamics of cognition using EEG and for developing effective and natural brain-computer interfaces.},

Left anterolateral superior temporal cortex showed a stronger response in blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to intelligible consonantal bursts compared with incomprehensible control sounds matched for spectrotemporal complexity. Simultaneously, the left posterior superior temporal plane (including planum temporale [PT]) exhibited a noncategorical responsivity to complex stimulus acoustics across all trials, showing no preference for intelligible speech sounds. Multistage hierarchical processing of speech sounds is thus revealed with fMRI, providing evidence for a role of the PT in the fundamental stages of the acoustic analysis of complex sounds, including speech.},

  abstract      = {Dichotic listening (DL) techniques have been used extensively as a non-invasive procedure to assess language lateralization among children with and without learning disabilities (LD), and with individuals who have other auditory system related brain disorders. Results of studies using DL have indicated that language is lateralized in children with LD and that the lateralized language asymmetries do not develop after age 6 nor are they affected by gender. Observed differences in lateralized language processes between control children and those with LD were found not due to delayed cerebral dominance, but rather to deficits in selective attention. In addition, attention factors have a greater influence on auditory processing of verbal than nonverbal stimuli for children with LD, and children with LD exhibit a general processing bias to the same hemisphere unlike control children. Furthermore, employing directed attention conditions in DL experiments has played an important role in explaining learning disabled children's performance on DL tasks. We conclude that auditory perceptual asymmetries as assessed by DL with children who experience LD are the result of the interaction of hemispheric capability and attention factors.},

In the present study, we investigated the complex effects of auditory-focused attention and the signal-to-noise ratio of sound stimuli on three different auditory evoked field components (auditory steady-state response, N1m, and sustained field) by means of magnetoencephalography. The results indicate that the auditory steady-state response originating in primary auditory cortex reflects the signal-to-noise ratio of physical sound inputs (bottom-up process) rather than the listener's attentional state (top-down process), whereas the sustained field, originating in nonprimary auditory cortex, reflects the attentional state rather than the signal-to-noise ratio. The N1m was substantially influenced by both bottom-up and top-down neural processes. The differential sensitivity of the components to bottom-up and top-down neural processes, contingent on their level in the processing pathway, suggests a stream from bottom-up driven sensory neural processing to top-down driven auditory perception within human auditory cortex.},

Training increased the strength of the response in visual cortex to trained objects compared with untrained objects. However, training did not simply induce a uniform increase in the response to trained objects: the magnitude of this training effect varied substantially across subregions of extrastriate cortex, with some showing a twofold increase in response to trained objects and others (including the right fusiform face area) showing no significant effect of training. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of training effects could not be predicted from the spatial distribution of either pretrained responses or face selectivity. Instead, training changed the spatial distribution of activity across the cortex.

Previous studies have observed patches in IT cortex with strong selectivity for highly familiar object classes (e.g., faces), but the principles behind this functional organization are largely unknown due to the many properties that distinguish different object classes. To unconfound shape from meaning and memory, we scanned monkeys with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed classes of initially novel objects. Our data revealed a topography of selectivity for these novel object classes across IT cortex. We found that this selectivity topography was highly reproducible and remarkably stable across a 3-month interval during which monkeys were extensively trained to discriminate among exemplars within one of the object classes. Furthermore, this selectivity topography was largely unaffected by changes in behavioral task and object retinal position, both of which preserve shape. In contrast, it was strongly influenced by changes in object shape. The topography was partially related to, but not explained by, the previously described pattern of face selectivity. Together, these results suggest that IT cortex contains a large-scale map of shape that is largely independent of meaning, familiarity, and behavioral task.},

  abstract      = {Acoustic stimuli are processed throughout the auditory projection pathway, including the neocortex, by neurons that are aggregated into 'tonotopic' maps according to their specific frequency tunings. Research on animals has shown that tonotopic representations are not statically fixed in the adult organism but can reorganize after damage to the cochlea or after training the intact subject to discriminate between auditory stimuli. Here we used functional magnetic source imaging (single dipole model) to measure cortical representations in highly skilled musicians. Dipole moments for piano tones, but not for pure tones of similar fundamental frequency (matched in loudness), were found to be enlarged by about 25\% in musicians compared with control subjects who had never played an instrument. Enlargement was correlated with the age at which musicians began to practise and did not differ between musicians with absolute or relative pitch. These results, when interpreted with evidence for modified somatosensory representations of the fingering digits in skilled violinists, suggest that use-dependent functional reorganization extends across the sensory cortices to reflect the pattern of sensory input processed by the subject during development of musical skill.},

  abstract      = {The present study asks in what way the activity of a neuronal population responding to a sensory stimulus could be most efficiently decoded, or 'read off', by the target neurons. A simple solution to this problem has been proposed - pooling the activity of responding neurons. However, pooling can be inefficient if sensory information is encoded by the 'label' of each neuron firing a spike. We have tested the efficiency of pooling by quantifying the extent to which information about a sensory stimulus is diminished when the identity of the individual neurons is lost by pooling. Analyzing the response of small groups of neurons in rat barrel cortex to single-whisker deflection, we found that pooling neurons within the same column is efficient for representing stimulus position; it causes a loss of only 1\% of the information about whether the principal whisker was stimulated, and a loss of 5-12\% of the finer information about which of nine possible whiskers (the principal and its neighbors) was stimulated. Cross-column pooling led to larger information losses, in the range of 25-55\%. Thus, to decode stimulus position from the discharge of barrel cortex populations, 'downstream' neurons could pool the activity arising from neurons of the same column, while maintaining the activity arising from neurons of separate columns at least partially segregated. Since such parcellation is present in some of the projections from barrel cortex, these findings suggest that columnar organization of barrel cortex serves to facilitate decoding of the location of the stimulated whisker.},

  abstract      = {Is the information transmitted by an ensemble of neurons determined solely by the number of spikes fired by each cell, or do correlations in the emission of action potentials also play a significant role? We derive a simple formula which enables this question to be answered rigorously for short time-scales. The formula quantifies the corrections to the instantaneous information rate which result from correlations in spike emission between pairs of neurons. The mutual information that the ensemble of neurons conveys about external stimuli can thus be broken down into firing rate and correlation components. This analysis provides fundamental constraints upon the nature of information coding, showing that over short time-scales correlations cannot dominate information representation, that stimulus-independent correlations may lead to synergy (where the neurons together convey more information than they would if they were considered independently), but that only certain combinations of the different sources of correlation result in significant synergy rather than in redundancy or in negligible effects. This analysis leads to a new quantification procedure which is directly applicable to simultaneous multiple neuron recordings.},

  abstract      = {Information Theory enables the quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural coding. The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called ``bias''). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.},

While empirical ad hoc procedures have been used to correct for such error, we have recently proposed a direct procedure consisting of the analytical calculation of the average error, its estimation (up to subleading terms) from the data, and its subtraction from raw information measures to yield unbiased measures. We calculate here the leading correction terms for both the average transmitted information and the conditional information and, since usually one must first regularize the data, we specify the expressions appropriate to different regularizations. Computer simulations indicate a broad range of validity of the analytical results, suggest the effectiveness of regularizing by simple binning and illustrate the advantage of this over the previously used 'bootstrap' procedure.},

  abstract      = {Several models have suggested that information transmission in the basal ganglia (BG) involves gating mechanisms, where neuronal activity modulates the extent of gate aperture and its duration. Here, we demonstrate that BG response duration is informative about a highly abstract stimulus feature and show that the duration of ``gate opening'' can indeed be used for information transmission through the BG. We analyzed recordings from three BG locations: the external part of the globus pallidus (GPe), the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) during performance of a probabilistic visuomotor task. Most (>85\%) of the neurons showed significant rate modulation following the appearance of cues predicting future reward. Trial-to-trial mutual information analysis revealed that response duration encoded reward prospects in many (42\%) of the responsive SNr neurons, as well as in the SNc (26.9\%), and the GPe (29.3\%). Whereas the low-frequency discharge SNc neurons responded with only an increase in firing rate, SNr and GPe neurons with high-frequency tonic discharge responded with both increases and decreases. Conversely, many duration-informative neurons in SNr (68\%) and GPe (50\%) responded with a decreased rather than an increased rate. The response duration was more informative than the extreme (minimal or maximal) amplitude or spike count in responsive bins of duration-informative neurons. Thus response duration is not simply correlated with the discharge rate and can provide additional information to the target structures of the BG.},

To address this question, we used intracranial recordings from nonprimary auditory cortex in the human superior temporal gyrus to determine what acoustic information in speech sounds can be reconstructed from population neural activity. We found that slow and intermediate temporal fluctuations, such as those corresponding to syllable rate, were accurately reconstructed using a linear model based on the auditory spectrogram. However, reconstruction of fast temporal fluctuations, such as syllable onsets and offsets, required a nonlinear sound representation based on temporal modulation energy. Reconstruction accuracy was highest within the range of spectro-temporal fluctuations that have been found to be critical for speech intelligibility. The decoded speech representations allowed readout and identification of individual words directly from brain activity during single trial sound presentations. These findings reveal neural encoding mechanisms of speech acoustic parameters in higher order human auditory cortex.},

We have previously found that many macaque V4 neurons are tuned for the curvature and object-centered position of boundary fragments (such as 'concavity on the right'). Here we tested the hypothesis that populations of such cells represent complete shapes as aggregates of boundary fragments. To estimate the population representation of a given shape, we scaled each cell's tuning peak by its response to that shape, summed across cells and smoothed. The resulting population response surface contained 3-8 peaks that represented major boundary features and could be used to reconstruct (approximately) the original shape. This exemplifies how a multi-peaked neural population response can represent a complex stimulus in terms of its constituent elements.},

We show that after learning, neurons in the primary motor cortex conveyed more information about the direction of movement and did so with relation to their directional sensitivity. Similar to recent findings in sensory systems, this specific improvement in encoding is correlated with an increase in the slope of the neurons' tuning curve. We further demonstrate that the improved information after learning enables a more accurate reconstruction of movement direction from neuronal populations. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms govern learning in sensory and motor areas and provide further evidence for a tight relationship between the locality of learning and the properties of neurons; namely, cells only show plasticity if their preferred direction is near the training one. The results also suggest that simple learning tasks can enhance the performance of brain-machine interfaces.},

The mushroom body is responsible for formation and retrieval of olfactory and other memories. The format of odor representations differs significantly across these structures. Whereas representations are dense, dynamic, and seemingly redundant in the antennal lobe, they are sparse and carried by more selective neurons in the mushroom body. This transformation relies on a combination of oscillatory dynamics and intrinsic and circuit properties that act together to selectively filter and synthesize the output from the antennal lobe. These results provide direct support for the functional relevance of correlation codes and shed some light on the role of oscillatory synchronization in sensory networks.},

If the null hypothesis is rejected-if dependence is attributed to the trains-the problem then becomes that of characterizing the nature and source of the observed dependencies. Statistical signs of various classes of dependencies, including direct interaction and shared input, are discussed and illustrated through computer simulations of interacting neurons. The effects of nonstationarities on the statistical measures for simultaneous spike trains are also discussed. For two-train comparisons of irregularly discharging nerve cells, moderate nonstationarities are shown to have little effect on the detection of interactions.Combining repetitive stimulation and simultaneous recording of spike trains from two (or more) neurons yields additional clues as to possible modes of interaction among the monitored neurons; the theory presented is illustrated by an application to experimentally obtained data from auditory neurons.A companion paper covers the analysis of single spike trains.},

We quantified the roles of individual spikes and spike patterns in encoding whisker stimulus location. 82\%-85\% of the total information was contained in the timing of individual spikes: first spike time was particularly crucial. Spike patterns within neurons accounted for the remaining 15\%-18\%. Neuron pairs located in the same barrel column coded redundantly, whereas pairs in neighboring barrel columns coded independently. The barrel cortical population code for stimulus location appears to be the time of single neurons' first poststimulus spikes-a fast, robust coding mechanism that does not rely on ``synergy'' in crossneuronal spike patterns.},

We used high-resolution surface mapping techniques (using functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) to examine activity in human auditory cortex during an intermodal selective attention task. Stimulus-dependent activations (SDAs), evoked by unattended sounds during demanding visual tasks, were maximal over mesial auditory cortex. They were tuned to sound frequency and location, and showed rapid adaptation to repeated sounds. Attention-related modulations (ARMs) were isolated as response enhancements that occurred when subjects performed pitch-discrimination tasks. In contrast to SDAs, ARMs were localized to lateral auditory cortex, showed broad frequency and location tuning, and increased in amplitude with sound repetition. The results suggest a functional dichotomy of auditory cortical fields: stimulus-determined mesial fields that faithfully transmit acoustic information, and attentionally labile lateral fields that analyze acoustic features of behaviorally relevant sounds.},

In humans, a voice region has been identified that is sensitive to human voices and vocalizations. As this region also strongly responds to speech, it is unclear whether it is tightly associated with linguistic processing and is thus unique to humans. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging of macaque monkeys (Old World primates, Macaca mulatta) we discovered a high-level auditory region that prefers species-specific vocalizations over other vocalizations and sounds. This region not only showed sensitivity to the 'voice' of the species, but also to the vocal identify of conspecific individuals. The monkey voice region is located on the superior-temporal plane and belongs to an anterior auditory 'what' pathway. These results establish functional relationships with the human voice region and support the notion that, for different primate species, the anterior temporal regions of the brain are adapted for recognizing communication signals from conspecifics.},

Vocal learning occurs in few animal taxa; similarities in the imitation process between humans and songbirds make the songbird a unique system in which vocal learning mechanisms can be studied at the neurobiological level. One theory of vocal learning proposes that early auditory experience generates auditory memories that subsequently guide vocal imitation. We now present a combination of behavioral and neurophysiological results, obtained in a songbird, that support this theory. We show that neurons in a forebrain auditory area of adult male zebra finches are selectively tuned to the song of a tutor heard early in development. Furthermore, the strength of this selectivity shows a striking correlation with the fidelity of vocal imitation, suggesting that this auditory memory may have served as the model for song learning.},

Recent data have challenged the widely held notion that only the developing auditory brain can be influenced by changes to the prevailing acoustic environment, unless those changes convey information of behavioral relevance. Specifically, it has been shown that persistent exposure of adult animals to random, bandlimited, moderately loud sounds can lead to a reorganization of auditory cortex not unlike that following restricted hearing loss. The mature auditory brain is thus more plastic than previously supposed, with potentially troubling consequences for those working or living in noisy environments, even at exposure levels considerably below those presently considered just-acceptable.},

  abstract      = {Birdsong is a learned vocal behaviour that requires intact hearing for its development in juveniles and for its maintenance during adulthood. However, the functional organization of the brain circuits involved in the perceptual processing of song has remained obscure. Here we provide evidence that GABAergic mechanisms are an important component of these circuits and participate in the auditory processing of birdsong. We first cloned a zebra finch homologue of the gene encoding the 65-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (zGAD-65), a specific GABAergic marker, and conducted an expression analysis by in situ hybridization to identify GABAergic cells and to map their distribution throughout auditory telencephalic areas. The results showed that field L2, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and the caudomedial mesopallium (CMM) contain a high number of GABAergic cells. Using patch-clamp brain slice recordings, we found abundant GABAergic mIPSCs in NCM. Pharmacological antagonism of mIPSCs induced large EPSC bursts, suggesting that tonic inhibition helps to stabilize NCM against runaway excitation via activation of GABA-A receptors. Next, using double fluorescence in situ hybridization and double immunocytochemical labelling, we demonstrated that large numbers of GABAergic cells in NCM and CMM show inducible expression of the transcriptional regulator ZENK in response to song auditory stimulation. These data provide direct evidence that GABAergic neurons in auditory brain regions are activated by song stimulation. Altogether, our results suggest that GABAergic mechanisms participate in auditory processing and perception, and might contribute to the memorization of birdsong.},

This new method considers, in an exact way, the effects of high order spike train statistics, with no approximation involved, and it generalizes our previous work that was valid for short time windows and small populations. The new technique permits one to quantify the information transmitted if each cell were to convey fully independent information separately from the information available in the presence of synergy-redundancy effects. Synergy-redundancy effects are shown to arise from three possible contributions: a redundant contribution due to similarities in the mean response profiles of different cells; a synergistic stimulus-dependent correlational contribution quantifying the information content of changes of correlations with stimulus, and a stimulus-independent correlational contribution term that reflects interactions between the distribution of rates of individual cells and the average level of cross-correlation. We apply the new method to simultaneously recorded data from somatosensory and visual cortices. We demonstrate that it constitutes a reliable tool to determine the role of cross-correlated activity in stimulus coding even when high firing rate data (such as multi-unit recordings) are considered.},

We tested whether topographic map plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex and a secondary auditory area, the suprarhinal auditory field, was controlled by the statistics of bottom-up sensory inputs or by top-down task-dependent influences. Rats were trained to attend to independent parameters, either frequency or intensity, within an identical set of auditory stimuli, allowing us to vary task demands while holding the bottom-up sensory inputs constant. We observed a clear double-dissociation in map plasticity in both cortical fields. Rats trained to attend to frequency cues exhibited an expanded representation of the target frequency range within the tonotopic map but no change in sound intensity encoding compared with controls. Rats trained to attend to intensity cues expressed an increased proportion of nonmonotonic intensity response profiles preferentially tuned to the target intensity range but no change in tonotopic map organization relative to controls. The degree of topographic map plasticity within the task-relevant stimulus dimension was correlated with the degree of perceptual learning for rats in both tasks. These data suggest that enduring receptive field plasticity in the adult auditory cortex may be shaped by task-specific top-down inputs that interact with bottom-up sensory inputs and reinforcement-based neuromodulator release. Top-down inputs might confer the selectivity necessary to modify a single feature representation without affecting other spatially organized feature representations embedded within the same neural circuitry.},

Previous studies have most often reported global linear or sublinear summation. An alternative view, supported by biophysical modeling studies, holds that thin dendrites provide a layer of independent computational 'subunits' that sigmoidally modulate their inputs prior to global summation. To distinguish these possibilities, we combined confocal imaging and dual-site focal synaptic stimulation of identified thin dendrites in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that nearby inputs on the same branch summed sigmoidally, whereas widely separated inputs or inputs to different branches summed linearly. This strong spatial compartmentalization effect is incompatible with a global summation rule and provides the first experimental support for a two-layer 'neural network' model of pyramidal neuron thin-branch integration. Our findings could have important implications for the computing and memory-related functions of cortical tissue.},

We show that odors evoke spiking activity that is sparse across the cortical population. We find that unbalanced synaptic excitation and inhibition underlie sparse activity: inhibition is widespread and broadly tuned, while excitation is less common and odor-specific. ``Global'' inhibition can be explained by local interneurons that receive ubiquitous and nonselective odor-evoked excitation. In the temporal domain, while respiration imposes a slow rhythm to olfactory cortical responses, odors evoke fast (15-30 Hz) oscillations in synaptic activity. Oscillatory excitation precedes inhibition, generating brief time windows for precise and temporally sparse spike output. Together, our results reveal that global inhibition and oscillations are major synaptic mechanisms shaping odor representations in olfactory cortex.},

With its poor temporal resolution fMRI has contributed little to the debate, while EEG-ERP paradigms have been hampered by the need to average the EEG in response to discrete stimuli which are superimposed onto ongoing speech. This presents a number of problems, foremost among which is that early attention effects in the form of endogenously generated potentials can be so temporally broad as to mask later attention effects based on the higher level processing of the speech stream. Here we overcome this issue by utilizing the AESPA (auditory evoked spread spectrum analysis) method which allows us to extract temporally detailed responses to two concurrently presented speech streams in natural cocktail-party-like attentional conditions without the need for superimposed probes. We show attentional effects on exogenous stimulus processing in the 200-220 ms range in the left hemisphere. We discuss these effects within the context of research on auditory scene analysis and in terms of a flexible locus of attention that can be deployed at a particular processing stage depending on the task.},

One idea is that this correspondence is established at the level of single neurons that are active when the individual performs a particular gesture or observes a similar gesture performed by another individual. Although neurons that display a precise auditory-vocal correspondence could facilitate vocal communication, they have yet to be identified. Here we report that a certain class of neurons in the swamp sparrow forebrain displays a precise auditory-vocal correspondence. We show that these neurons respond in a temporally precise fashion to auditory presentation of certain note sequences in this songbird's repertoire and to similar note sequences in other birds' songs. These neurons display nearly identical patterns of activity when the bird sings the same sequence, and disrupting auditory feedback does not alter this singing-related activity, indicating it is motor in nature. Furthermore, these neurons innervate striatal structures important for song learning, raising the possibility that singing-related activity in these cells is compared to auditory feedback to guide vocal learning.},

We therefore argue that speech-specific processing emerges from differential demands on auditory and conceptual processes that are shared by speech and non-speech stimuli. This has implications for domain- vs. process-specific cognitive models, and for the relative importance of segregation and integration in functional anatomy.},

These neurons are involved in direction perception, but it is not clear how perceptual decisions are related to the population response. We recorded the activities of MT neurons in rhesus monkeys while they discriminated closely related directions, and examined the relationship between the activities of neurons tuned to different directions and the monkeys' choices. Perceptual decisions were significantly correlated with the activities of the highest-precision neurons but not with those of the lowest-precision neurons. The combined performance of the high-precision neurons matched the monkeys' behavior, whereas the ability to predict behavior based on the entire active population was poor. These results suggest that fine discrimination decisions are crucially dependent on the activities of the most informative neurons.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: The degradome -the complete repertoire of proteases in an organism- is involved in multiple key biological and pathological processes. Previous studies in several organisms have yielded sets of curated protease sequences which may be used to characterize the degradome in a novel genome by similarity. Differences between degradomes can then be related to physiological traits of the species under study. Therefore, the sequencing of the zebra finch genome allows the comparison between the degradomes of mammals and birds and may help to understand the biological peculiarities of the zebra finch. RESULTS: A set of curated protease sequences from humans and chicken was used to predict the sequences of 460 protease and protease-like genes in the zebra finch genome. This analysis revealed important differences in the evolution of mammalian and bird degradomes, including genomic expansions and deletions of caspases, cytotoxic proteases, kallikreins, matrix metalloproteases, and trypsin-like proteases. Furthermore, we found several zebra finch-specific features, such as duplications in CASP3 and BACE, and a large genomic expansion of acrosin. CONCLUSIONS: We have compared the degradomes of zebra finch, chicken and several mammalian species, with the finding of multiple differences which illustrate the evolution of the protease complement of these organisms. Detailed analysis of these changes in zebra finch proteases has shown that they are mainly related to immunological, developmental, reproductive and neural functions.},

  abstract      = {Different pictures of Marilyn Monroe can evoke the same percept, even if greatly modified as in Andy Warhol's famous portraits. But how does the brain recognize highly variable pictures as the same percept? Various studies have provided insights into how visual information is processed along the ``ventral pathway,'' via both single-cell recordings in monkeys and functional imaging in humans. Interestingly, in humans, the same ``concept'' of Marilyn Monroe can be evoked with other stimulus modalities, for instance by hearing or reading her name. Brain imaging studies have identified cortical areas selective to voices and visual word forms. However, how visual, text, and sound information can elicit a unique percept is still largely unknown. By using presentations of pictures and of spoken and written names, we show that (1) single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) respond selectively to representations of the same individual across different sensory modalities; (2) the degree of multimodal invariance increases along the hierarchical structure within the MTL; and (3) such neuronal representations can be generated within less than a day or two. These results demonstrate that single neurons can encode percepts in an explicit, selective, and invariant manner, even if evoked by different sensory modalities.},

However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single events by evaluating the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore, to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies. Two related approaches--decoding and information theory--can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.},

  abstract      = {We examine the use of synchronization as a mechanism for extracting parameter and state information from experimental systems. We focus on important aspects of this problem that have received little attention previously and we explore them using experiments and simulations with the chaotic Colpitts oscillator as an example system. We explore the impact of model imperfection on the ability to extract valid information from an experimental system. We compare two optimization methods: an initial value method and a constrained method. Each of these involves coupling the model equations to the experimental data in order to regularize the chaotic motions on the synchronization manifold. We explore both time-dependent and time-independent coupling and discuss the use of periodic impulse coupling. We also examine both optimized and fixed (or manually adjusted) coupling. For the case of an optimized time-dependent coupling function u(t) we find a robust structure which includes sharp peaks and intervals where it is zero. This structure shows a strong correlation with the location in phase space and appears to depend on noise, imperfections of the model, and the Lyapunov direction vectors. For time-independent coupling we find the counterintuitive result that often the optimal rms error in fitting the model to the data initially increases with coupling strength. Comparison of this result with that obtained using simulated data may provide one measure of model imperfection. The constrained method with time-dependent coupling appears to have benefits in synchronizing long data sets with minimal impact, while the initial value method with time-independent coupling tends to be substantially faster, more flexible, and easier to use. We also describe a method of coupling which is useful for sparse experimental data sets. Our use of the Colpitts oscillator allows us to explore in detail the case of a system with one positive Lyapunov exponent. The methods we explored are easily extended to driven systems such as neurons with time-dependent injected current. They are expected to be of value in nonchaotic systems as well.

One important property is the spectrotemporal contrast in the acoustic environment: the variation in sound pressure in each frequency band, relative to the mean pressure. We show that neurons in ferret auditory cortex rescale their gain to partially compensate for the spectrotemporal contrast of recent stimulation. When contrast is low, neurons increase their gain, becoming more sensitive to small changes in the stimulus, although the effectiveness of contrast gain control is reduced at low mean levels. Gain is primarily determined by contrast near each neuron's preferred frequency, but there is also a contribution from contrast in more distant frequency bands. Neural responses are modulated by contrast over timescales of approximately 100 ms. By using contrast gain control to expand or compress the representation of its inputs, the auditory system may be seeking an efficient coding of natural sounds.},

Yet studies in primary visual cortex have found that changes in neuronal response properties were relatively modest. The present study examines the effects of training in an orientation discrimination task on the response properties of V4 neurons in awake rhesus monkeys. Results indicate that the changes induced in V4 are indeed larger than those in V1. Nonspecific effects of training included a decrease in response variance, and an increase in overall orientation selectivity in V4. The orientation-specific changes involved a local steepening in the orientation tuning curve around the trained orientation that selectively improved orientation discriminability at the trained orientation. Moreover, these changes were largely confined to the population of neurons whose orientation tuning was optimal for signaling small differences in orientation at the trained orientation. Finally, the modifications were restricted to the part of the tuning curve close to the trained orientation. Thus, we conclude that it is the most informative V4 neurons, those most directly involved in the discrimination, that are specifically modified by perceptual learning.},

Monkeys performed a 'delayed-matching-to-sample' task with an array of three objects. Only one of the objects in the array was relevant for task performance and the monkeys needed to find that object (the target) and remember its location. For many PF neurons, activity to physically identical arrays varied with the target location; the location of the non-target objects had little or no influence on activity. Information about the target location was present in activity as early as 140ms after array onset. Also, information about which object was the target was reflected in the sustained activity of many PF neurons. These results suggest that the prefrontal cortex is involved in selecting and maintaining behaviourally relevant information.},

  abstract      = {Speech and language are considered uniquely human abilities: animals have communication systems, but they do not match human linguistic skills in terms of recursive structure and combinatorial power. Yet, in evolution, spoken language must have emerged from neural mechanisms at least partially available in animals. In this paper, we will demonstrate how our understanding of speech perception, one important facet of language, has profited from findings and theory in nonhuman primate studies. Chief among these are physiological and anatomical studies showing that primate auditory cortex, across species, shows patterns of hierarchical structure, topographic mapping and streams of functional processing. We will identify roles for different cortical areas in the perceptual processing of speech and review functional imaging work in humans that bears on our understanding of how the brain decodes and monitors speech. A new model connects structures in the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes linking speech perception and production.},

  abstract      = {The functional specialization and hierarchical organization of multiple areas in rhesus monkey auditory cortex were examined with various types of complex sounds. Neurons in the lateral belt areas of the superior temporal gyrus were tuned to the best center frequency and bandwidth of band-passed noise bursts. They were also selective for the rate and direction of linear frequency modulated sweeps. Many neurons showed a preference for a limited number of species-specific vocalizations (``monkey calls''). These response selectivities can be explained by nonlinear spectral and temporal integration mechanisms. In a separate series of experiments, monkey calls were presented at different spatial locations, and the tuning of lateral belt neurons to monkey calls and spatial location was determined. Of the three belt areas the anterolateral area shows the highest degree of specificity for monkey calls, whereas neurons in the caudolateral area display the greatest spatial selectivity. We conclude that the cortical auditory system of primates is divided into at least two processing streams, a spatial stream that originates in the caudal part of the superior temporal gyrus and projects to the parietal cortex, and a pattern or object stream originating in the more anterior portions of the lateral belt. A similar division of labor can be seen in human auditory cortex by using functional neuroimaging.},

Bandpassed noise bursts with defined center frequencies evoked responses that were greatly enhanced over those evoked by pure tones. This finding led to the discovery of at least one new cochleotopic area in the lateral belt of the nonprimary auditory cortex. The best center frequencies of neurons varied along a rostrocaudal axis, and the best bandwidths of the noise bursts varied along a mediolateral axis. When digitized monkey calls were used as stimuli, many neurons showed a preference for some calls over others. Manipulation of the calls' frequency structure and playback of separate components revealed different types of spectral integration. The lateral areas of the monkey auditory cortex appear to be part of a hierarchical sequence in which neurons prefer increasingly complex stimuli and may form an important stage in the preprocessing of communication sounds.},

  abstract      = {Auditory cortex on the exposed supratemporal plane in four anesthetized rhesus monkeys was mapped electrophysiologically with both pure-tone (PT) and broad-band complex sounds. The mapping confirmed the existence of at least three tonotopic areas. Primary auditory cortex, AI, was then aspirated, and the remainder of the cortex on the supratemporal plane was remapped. PT-responses in the caudomedial area, CM, were abolished in all animals but one, in which they were restricted to the high-frequency range. Some CM sites were still responsive to complex stimuli. In contrast to the effects on CM, no significant changes were detectable in the rostral area, R. After mapping cortex in four additional monkeys, injections were made with different tracers into matched best-frequency regions of AI, R, and CM. Injections in AI and R led to retrograde labeling of neurons in all three subdivisions of the medial geniculate (MG) nucleus (MGv, MGd, and MGm), as well as nuclei outside MG, whereas CM injections led to only sparse labeling of neurons in a restricted zone of the lateral MGd and, possibly, MGm, in addition to labeling in non-MG sites. The combined results suggest that MGv sends direct projections in parallel to areas AI and R, which drive PT-responses in both areas. PT-responses in area CM, however, appear to be driven by input relayed serially from AI. The direct input to CM from MGd and other thalamic nuclei may thus be capable of mediating responses only to broad-band sounds.},

The responses of cortical neurons evoked by cutaneous stimulation were investigated in the hand representation of cortical area 3a in adult owl monkeys that had been trained in a tactile frequency discrimination task. Cortical representations of the hands in these experimental hemispheres were compared with those representing the opposite, untrained hand, as well as with those representing a passively stimulated hand in a second class of control monkeys. 2. A large cutaneous representation of the hairy and glabrous skin surfaces of the hand emerged in area 3a in each trained hemisphere. 3. With the emergence of cutaneous responses recorded for neurons at many area 3a locations, the normally recorded deep receptor inputs were no longer evident at most of these locations. 4. There was a greater territory of representation of the small area of skin that was stimulated in the behavioral task in trained monkeys, when compared with the representations of corresponding skin sites in the opposite hemisphere of the same monkeys, or to the representations of equivalent skin sites stimulated in passively stimulated control monkeys. 5. There was great variability in the receptive-field properties of neurons responsive to cutaneous inputs among trained monkeys. In most recording sites within the representations of the behaviorally engaged hands, the cutaneous receptive fields were large, extending over a significant part of the glabrous or hairy surfaces of the hand. However, in one monkey, very small, topographically ordered cutaneous receptive fields were recorded over a wide zone of area 3a. 6. The physiologically defined borders between areas 3a and 3b were in register with the cytoarchitectonically defined borders between these two cortical areas in trained and in control monkeys. 7. This study demonstrates that there is a reorganization of the cutaneous and ``deep'' representation of hand in cortical area 3a, with the main change being an emergence of a large cutaneous representation and the parallel disappearance of a large part of the normal deep representation in this field. These changes are discussed in light of the possible functional roles of cortical area 3a.},

  abstract      = {1. Adult owl monkeys were trained to detect differences in the frequency of a tactile flutter-vibration stimulus above a 20-Hz standard. All stimuli were delivered to a constant skin site restricted to a small part of a segment of one finger. The frequency-difference discrimination performance of all but one of these monkeys improved progressively with training. 2. The distributed responses of cortical neurons (``maps'') of the hand surfaces were defined in detail in somatosensory cortical area 3b. Representations of trained hands were compared with those of the opposite, untrained hand, and to the area 3b representations of hands in a second set of monkeys that were stimulated tactually in the same manner while these monkeys were attending to auditory stimuli (passive stimulation controls). 3. The cortical representations of the trained hands were substantially more complex in topographic detail than the representations of unstimulated hands or of passively stimulated control hands. 4. In all well-trained monkeys the representations of the restricted skin location trained in the behavioral task were significantly (1.5 to greater than 3 times) greater in area than were the representations of equivalent skin locations on control digits. However, the overall extents of the representations of behaviorally stimulated fingers were not larger than those of control fingers in the same hemisphere, or in opposite hemisphere controls. 5. The receptive fields representing the trained skin were significantly larger than receptive fields representing control digits in all but one trained monkey. The largest receptive fields were centered in the zone of representation of the behaviorally engaged skin, but they were not limited to it. Large receptive fields were recorded in a 1- to 2-mm-wide zone in the area 3b maps of trained hands. 6. Receptive-field sizes were also statistically significantly larger on at least one adjacent, untrained digit when compared with the receptive fields recorded on the homologous digit of the opposite hand. 7. There was an increase in the percent overlaps of receptive fields in the cortical zone of representation of the trained skin. A significant number of receptive fields were centered on the behaviorally trained skin site. 8. The effects of increased topographic complexity, increased representation of the trained skin location, increased receptive-field size, and increased receptive-field overlap were not observed in the representations of the untrained hands in these same monkeys. Only modest increases in topographic complexity were recorded in the representations of passively stimulated hands, and no effects on receptive-field size or overlap were noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract      = {1. Temporal response characteristics of neurons were sampled in fine spatial grain throughout the hand representations in cortical areas 3a and 3b in adult owl monkeys. These monkeys had been trained to detect small differences in tactile stimulus frequencies in the range of 20-30 Hz. Stimuli were presented to an invariant, restricted spot on a single digit. 2. The absolute numbers of cortical locations and the cortical area over which neurons showed entrained frequency-following responses to behaviorally important stimuli were significantly greater when stimulation was applied to the trained skin, as compared with stimulation on an adjacent control digit, or at corresponding skin sites in passively stimulated control animals. 3. Representational maps defined with sinusoidal stimuli were not identical to maps defined with just-visible tapping stimuli. Receptive-field/frequency-following response site mismatches were recorded in every trained monkey. Mismatches were less frequently recorded in the representations of control skin surfaces. 4. At cortical locations with entrained responses, neither the absolute firing rates of neurons nor the degree of the entrainment of the response were correlated with behavioral discrimination performance. 5. All area 3b cortical locations with entrained responses evoked by stimulation at trained or untrained skin sites were combined to create population peristimulus time and cycle histograms. In all cases, stimulation of the trained skin resulted in 1) larger-amplitude responses, 2) peak responses earlier in the stimulus cycle, and 3) temporally sharper responses, than did stimulation applied to control skin sites. 6. The sharpening of the response of cortical area 3b neurons relative to the period of the stimulus could be accounted for by a large subpopulation of neurons that had highly coherent responses. 7. Analysis of cycle histograms for area 3b neuron responses revealed that the decreased variance in the representation of each stimulus cycle could account for behaviorally measured frequency discrimination performance. A strong correlation between these temporal response distributions and the discriminative performances for stimuli applied at all studied skin surfaces was even stronger (r = 0.98) if only the rising phases of cycle histogram were considered in the analysis. 8. The responses of neurons in area 3a could not account for measured differences in frequency discrimination performance. 9. These representational changes did not occur in monkeys that were stimulated on the same schedule but were performing an auditory discrimination task during skin stimulation. 10. It is concluded that by behaviorally training adult owl monkeys to discriminate the temporal features of a tactile stimulus, distributed spatial and temporal response properties of cortical neurons are altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Here we report an increase in the cortical area of representation of a restricted frequency range in primary auditory cortex of adult owl monkeys that is correlated with the animal's performance at a frequency discrimination task. Monkeys trained for several weeks to discriminate small differences in the frequency of sequentially presented tonal stimuli revealed a progressive improvement in performance with training. At the end of the training period, the tonotopic organization of Al was defined by recording multiple-unit responses at 70-258 cortical locations. These responses were compared to those derived from three normal monkeys and from two monkeys that received the same auditory stimuli but that were engaged in a tactile discrimination task. The cortical representation, the sharpness of tuning, and the latency of the response were greater for the behaviorally relevant frequencies of trained monkeys when compared to the same frequencies of control monkeys. The cortical area of representation was the only studied parameter that was correlated with behavioral performance. These results demonstrate that attended natural stimulation can modify the tonotopic organization of Al in the adult primate, and that this alteration is correlated with changes in perceptual acuity.},

Yet, existing models have failed to predict the diverse shapes of receptive fields that occur in nature. The existing models used a particular ``soft'' form of sparseness that limits average neuronal activity. Here we study models of efficient coding in a broader context by comparing soft and ``bard'' forms of neuronal sparseness. As a result of our analyses, we propose a novel network model for visual cortex. The model forms efficient visual representations in which the number of active neurones, rather than mean neuronal activity, is limited. This form of hard sparseness also economises cortical resources like synaptic memory and metabolic energy. Furthermore, our model accurately predicts the distribution of receptive field shapes found in the primary visual cortex of cat and monkey.},

  abstract      = {We estimate the rates at which neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized macaque monkeys transmit stimulus-related information in response to three types of visual stimulus. The stimuli-randomly modulated checkerboard patterns, stationary sinusoidal gratings, and drifting sinusoidal gratings-have very different spatiotemporal structures. We obtain the overall rate of information transmission, which we call formal information, by a direct method. We find the highest information rates in the responses of simple cells to drifting gratings (median: 10.3 bits/s, 0.92 bits/spike); responses to randomly modulated stimuli and stationary gratings transmit information at significantly lower rates. In general, simple cells transmit information at higher rates, and over a larger range, than do complex cells. Thus in the responses of V1 neurons, stimuli that are rapidly modulated do not necessarily evoke higher information rates, as might be the case with motion-sensitive neurons in area MT. By an extension of the direct method, we parse the formal information into attribute-specific components, which provide estimates of the information transmitted about contrast and spatiotemporal pattern. We find that contrast-specific information rates vary across neurons-about 0.3 to 2.1 bits/s or 0.05 to 0.22 bits/spike-but depend little on stimulus type. Spatiotemporal pattern-specific information rates, however, depend strongly on the type of stimulus and neuron (simple or complex). The remaining information rate, typically between 10 and 32\% of the formal information rate for each neuron, cannot be unambiguously assigned to either contrast or spatiotemporal pattern. This indicates that some information concerning these two stimulus attributes is confounded in the responses of single neurons in V1. A model that considers a simple cell to consist of a linear spatiotemporal filter followed by a static rectifier predicts higher information rates than are found in real neurons and completely fails to replicate the performance of real cells in generating the confounded information.},

  abstract      = {It has become increasingly clear that the standard nomenclature for many telencephalic and related brainstem structures of the avian brain is based on flawed once-held assumptions of homology to mammalian brain structures, greatly hindering functional comparisons between avian and mammalian brains. This has become especially problematic for those researchers studying the neurobiology of birdsong, the largest single group within the avian neuroscience community. To deal with the many communication problems this has caused among researchers specializing in different vertebrate classes, the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum, held at Duke University from July 18-20, 2002, set out to develop a new terminology for the avian telencephalon and some allied brainstem cell groups. In one major step, the erroneous conception that the avian telencephalon consists mainly of a hypertrophied basal ganglia has been purged from the telencephalic terminology, and the actual parts of the basal ganglia and its brainstem afferent cell groups have been given new names to reflect their now-evident homologies. The telencephalic regions that were incorrectly named to reflect presumed homology to mammalian basal ganglia have been renamed as parts of the pallium. The prefixes used for the new names for the pallial subdivisions have retained most established abbreviations, in an effort to maintain continuity with the pre-existing nomenclature. Here we present a brief synopsis of the inaccuracies in the old nomenclature, a summary of the nomenclature changes, and details of changes for specific songbird vocal and auditory nuclei. We believe this new terminology will promote more accurate understanding of the broader neurobiological implications of song control mechanisms and facilitate the productive exchange of information between researchers studying avian and mammalian systems.},

We argue that the variety and complexity of the results reported in the literature emerge from the variety of empirical protocols that were used, such that the results observed in any one experiment depended on the stimulus conditions and the subject's attentional strategy, a notion that we define precisely in terms of the attention field in the model, but that has not typically been completely under experimental control.},

To test conflicting predictions of these alternative models, we recorded responses of V4 neurons to stimuli across a range of luminance contrasts and measured the change in response when monkeys attended to them in order to discriminate a target stimulus from nontargets. Attention caused greater increases in response at low contrast than at high contrast, consistent with an increase in effective stimulus strength. On average, attention increased the effective contrast of the attended stimulus by a factor of 1.51, an increase of 51\% of its physical contrast.},

  abstract      = {The effect of selective attention on activity of the right human auditory cortex was studied with a 24-channel planar SQUID-gradiometer. Two conditions were used, favoring either a late attention effect following N100m, or an early effect, overlapping with N100m. In experiment 1 (15 subjects), a randomized tone sequence of 1 and 3 kHz tones was delivered to the left ear with a constant interstimulus interval (ISI) of 405 msec. The subjects' task was to count infrequent longer tones of one of these pitches among shorter standards. An attention effect, called magnetic difference (Md), was found when the responses to the irrelevant standards were subtracted from those to the relevant standards. Md peaked at about 220 msec for the 1 kHz tones and at 195 msec for the 3 kHz tones. The equivalent source of Md was in the supratemporal auditory cortex, about 1 cm anterior to the source of N100m, and in the same location as the source of P200m. In experiment 2 (8 subjects) the paradigm was similar, except that the 1 kHz and 3 kHz tones were led to different ears with a random ISI of 240-300 msec. In this case Md started already at 30-40 msec, adding to the N100m deflection, and the sources of N100m and Md overlapped. Present results show that attention can modify the activity of two different areas in the supratemporal auditory cortex. We interpret both attention effects as alterations of the exogenous evoked response components: the earlier effect as changed activity in neurons underlying N100m to relevant tones and the later effect as a modification of P200m to irrelevant tones.},

  abstract      = {Single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is tuned to mixtures of multiple task-related aspects. Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.},

Consistent with previous observations, we found that both increase in stimulation rate and attention to sounds enhanced activity in STC bilaterally. Further, we observed larger attention effects with higher stimulation rates. This interaction of attention and presentation rate has not been reported previously.

Tutor song-contingent optogenetic or electrical disruption of neural activity in the pupil's song premotor nucleus HVC prevented song copying, indicating that a premotor structure important to the temporal control of birdsong also helps encode the tutor song. In vivo multiphoton imaging and neural manipulations delineated a pathway and a candidate synaptic mechanism through which tutor song information is encoded by premotor circuits.

  abstract      = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex invariably involves the activation of millions of neurons that are widely distributed over its various areas. These distributed activity patterns need to be integrated into coherent representational states. A candidate mechanism for the integration and coordination of neuronal activity between different brain regions is synchronization on a fine temporal scale. In the visual cortex, synchronization occurs selectively between the responses of neurons that represent related features and that need to be integrated for the generation of coherent percepts; neurons in other areas of the cerebral cortex also synchronize their discharges. However, little is known about the patterns and the behavioural correlates of synchrony among widely separated cortical regions. Here we report that synchronization occurs between areas of the visual and parietal cortex, and between areas of the parietal and motor cortex, in the awake cat. When cats responded to a sudden change of a visual pattern, neuronal activity in cortical areas exhibited synchrony without time lags; this synchrony was particularly strong between areas subserving related functions. During reward and inter-trial episodes, zero-time-lag synchrony was lost and replaced by interactions exhibiting large and unsystematic time lags.},

  abstract      = {1. To analyze the information represented about individual odor stimuli in the responses of single olfactory neurons in the primate orbitofrontal area, neuronal responses were measured to a set of seven to nine odorants in macaques performing an olfactory discrimination task. The population of neurons analyzed had responses that were significantly differential to the odorants. 2. Information theoretic analyses were applied to the responses of the neurons, and information measures were calculated from the firing rate of the responses and from the principal components of the responses. The information reflected by the firing rate of the response accounted for the majority of the information present (86\%) when compared with the information derived from the first three principal components of the spike train. This indicated that temporal encoding had a very minor role in the encoding of olfactory information by single orbitofrontal olfactory cells. 3. The average information about which odorant was presented, averaged across the 38 neurons, was 0.09 bits, a figure that is low when compared with the information values previously published for the responses of temporal lobe face-selective neurons. 4. Application of information theoretic analyses to the responses of these neurons showed how much information about which stimulus was delivered was present in the responses of individual neurons. It was found that for the majority of the neurons significant amounts of information were reflected about one or two of the odorants presented. 5. For each neuron, the information reflected in the responses of that neuron about the reinforcement value and the information about the identity of the odorants were calculated. It is shown that many neurons carry information about which of the odorants was presented; in addition, some neurons reflect information only about the taste association of the stimuli and not about odorant identity. 6. Measurements of the sparseness of the representation indicated that a broadly distributed representation of the identity of odorants was present in this population of neurons.},

  abstract      = {To analyze the extent to which populations of neurons encode information in the numbers of spikes each neuron emits or in the relative time of firing of the different neurons that might reflect synchronization, we developed and analyzed the performance of an information theoretic approach. The formula quantifies the corrections to the instantaneous information rate that result from correlations in spike emission between pairs of neurons. We showed how these cross-cell terms can be separated from the correlations that occur between the spikes emitted by each neuron, the auto-cell terms in the information rate expansion. We also described a method to test whether the estimate of the amount of information contributed by stimulus-dependent synchronization is significant. With simulated data, we show that the approach can separate information arising from the number of spikes emitted by each neuron from the redundancy that can arise if neurons have common inputs and from the synergy that can arise if cells have stimulus-dependent synchronization. The usefulness of the approach is also demonstrated by showing how it helps to interpret the encoding shown by neurons in the primate inferior temporal visual cortex. When applied to a sample dataset of simultaneously recorded inferior temporal cortex neurons, the algorithm showed that most of the information is available in the number of spikes emitted by each cell; that there is typically just a small degree (approximately 12\%) of redundancy between simultaneously recorded inferior temporal cortex (IT) neurons; and that there is very little gain of information that arises from stimulus-dependent synchronization effects in these neurons.},

  abstract      = {1. To analyze the selectivity and the sparseness of firing to visual stimuli of single neurons in the primate temporal cortical visual area, neuronal responses were measured to a set of 68 visual stimuli in macaques performing a visual fixation task. The population of neurons analyzed had responses that occurred primarily to faces. The stimuli included 23 faces, and 45 nonface images of real-world scenes, so that the function of this brain region could be analyzed when it was processing natural scenes. 2. The neurons were selected to meet the previously used criteria of face selectivity by responding more than twice as much to the optimal face as to the optimal nonface stimulus in the set. Application of information theoretic analyses to the responses of these neurons confirmed that their responses contained much more information about which of 20 face stimuli had been seen (on average 0.4 bits) than about which (of 20) nonface stimuli had been seen (on average 0.07 bits). 3. The sparseness of the representation of a scene or object provided by each of these neurons (which can be thought of as the proportion of stimuli to which the neuron responds, and which is fundamental to understanding the network operation of the system) can be defined as [formula: see text] where ri is the firing rate to the ith stimulus in the set of n stimuli. The sparseness has a maximal value of 1.0. It was found that the sparseness of the representation of the 68 stimuli by each neuron had an average across all neurons of 0.65. This indicates a rather distributed representation. 4. If the spontaneous firing rate was subtracted from the firing rate of the neuron to each stimulus, so that the changes of firing rate, i.e., the responses of the neurons, were used in the sparseness calculation, then the ``response sparseness'' had a lower value, with a mean of 0.33 for the population of neurons, or 0.60 if calculated over the set of faces. 5. Multidimensional scaling to produce a stimulus space represented by this population of neurons showed that the different faces were well separated in the space created, whereas the different nonface stimuli were grouped together in the space. 6. The information analyses and multidimensional scaling provided evidence that what was made explicit in the responses of these neurons was information about which face had been seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract      = {It has been shown that it is possible to read, from the firing rates of just a small population of neurons, the code that is used in the macaque temporal lobe visual cortex to distinguish between different faces being looked at. To analyse the information provided by populations of single neurons in the primate temporal cortical visual areas, the responses of a population of 14 neurons to 20 visual stimuli were analysed in a macaque performing a visual fixation task. The population of neurons analysed responded primarily to faces, and the stimuli utilised were all human and monkey faces. Each neuron had its own response profile to the different members of the stimulus set. The mean response of each neuron to each stimulus in the set was calculated from a fraction of the ten trials of data available for every stimulus. From the remaining data, it was possible to calculate, for any population response vector, the relative likelihoods that it had been elicited by each of the stimuli in the set. By comparison with the stimuli actually shown, the mean percentage correct identification was computed and also the mean information about the stimuli, in bits, that the population of neurons carried on a single trial. When the decoding algorithm used for this calculation approximated an optimal, Bayesian estimate of the relative likelihoods, the percentage correct increased from 14\% correct (chance was 5\% correct) with one neuron to 67\% with 14 neurons. The information conveyed by the population of neurons increased approximately linearly from 0.33 bits with one neuron to 2.77 bits with 14 neurons. This leads to the important conclusion that the number of stimuli that can be encoded by a population of neurons in this part of the visual system increases approximately exponentially as the number of cells in the sample increases (in that the log of the number of stimuli increases almost linearly). This is in contrast to a local encoding scheme (of ``grandmother'' cells), in which the number of stimuli encoded increases linearly with the number of cells in the sample. Thus one of the potentially important properties of distributed representations, an exponential increase in the number of stimuli that can be represented, has been demonstrated in the brain with this population of neurons. When the algorithm used for estimating stimulus likelihood was as simple as could be easily implemented by neurons receiving the population's output (based on just the dot product between the population response vector and each mean response vector), it was still found that the 14-neuron population produced 66\% correct guesses and conveyed 2.30 bits of information, or 83\% of the information that could be extracted with the nearly optimal procedure. It was also shown that, although there was some redundancy in the representation (with each neuron contributing to the information carried by the whole population 60\% of the information it carried alone, rather than 100\%), this is due to the fact that the number of stimuli in the set was limited (it was 20). The data are consistent with minimal redundancy for sufficiently large and diverse sets of stimuli. The implication for brain connectivity of the distributed encoding scheme, which was demonstrated here in the case of faces, is that a neuron can receive a great deal of information about what is encoded by a large population of neurons if it is able to receive its inputs from a random subset of these neurons, even of limited numbers (e.g. hundreds).},

The stimuli included 23 faces and 42 nonface images of real-world scenes, so that the function of this brain region could be analyzed when it was processing relatively natural scenes. It was found that for the majority of the neurons significant amounts of information were reflected about which of several of the 23 faces had been seen. Thus the representation was not local, for in a local representation almost all the information available can be obtained when the single stimulus to which the neuron responds best is shown. It is shown that the information available about any one stimulus depended on how different (for example, how many standard deviations) the response to that stimulus was from the average response to all stimuli. This was the case for responses below the average response as well as above. It is shown that the fraction of information carried by the low firing rates of a cell was large--much larger than that carried by the high firing rates. Part of the reason for this is that the probability distribution of different firing rates is biased toward low values (though with fewer very low values than would be predicted by an exponential distribution). Another factor is that the variability of the response is large at intermediate and high firing rates. Another finding is that at short sampling intervals (such as 20 ms) the neurons code information efficiently, by effectively acting as binary variables and behaving less noisily than would be expected of a Poisson process.},

  abstract      = {Over the past decade, renewed interest in the auditory system has resulted in a surge of anatomical and physiological research in the primate auditory cortex and its targets. Anatomical studies have delineated multiple areas in and around primary auditory cortex and demonstrated connectivity among these areas, as well as between these areas and the rest of the cortex, including prefrontal cortex. Physiological recordings of auditory neurons have found that species-specific vocalizations are useful in probing the selectivity and potential functions of acoustic neurons. A number of cortical regions contain neurons that are robustly responsive to vocalizations, and some auditory responsive neurons show more selectivity for vocalizations than for other complex sounds. Demonstration of selectivity for vocalizations has prompted the question of which features are encoded by higher-order auditory neurons. Results based on detailed studies of the structure of these vocalizations, as well as the tuning and information-coding properties of neurons sensitive to these vocalizations, have begun to provide answers to this question. In future studies, these and other methods may help to define the way in which cells, ensembles, and brain regions process communication sounds. Moreover, the discovery that several nonprimary auditory cortical regions may be multisensory and responsive to vocalizations with corresponding facial gestures may change the way in which we view the processing of communication information by the auditory system.},

The optimal combination of responses is determined both by their dependence on the sensory stimulus and by their cofluctuations across trials-that is, the noise correlations. Positively correlated noise is considered deleterious, because it limits the coding accuracy of populations of similarly tuned neurons. However, positively correlated fluctuations between differently tuned neurons actually increase coding accuracy, because they allow the common noise to be subtracted without signal loss. This is demonstrated with data recorded from the secondary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a vibrotactile discrimination task. The results indicate that positive correlations are not always harmful and may be exploited by cortical networks to enhance the neural representation of features to be discriminated.},

  abstract      = {The electric fish, Eigenmannia, is able to discriminate the sign of the frequency difference, Df, between a neighbor's electric organ discharges (EODs) and its own. The fish lowers its EOD frequency for positive Dfs and raises its frequency for negative Dfs to minimize jamming of its electrolocation ability by a neighbor's EODs of similar frequency. This jamming avoidance response (JAR) is controlled by a group of 'sign-selective' neurons in the prepacemaker nucleus (PPN) that is located at the boundary of the midbrain and the diencephalon (Fig. 1). Extracellular recordings from a total of 35 neurons revealed a great similarity between behavioral and neuronal response properties: 1. All neurons fired vigorously for negative Dfs and were almost silent for positive Dfs, regardless of the orientation of the jamming stimulus, and thus discriminated the sign of Df unambiguously (Fig. 2). 2. In accordance with behavioral observations, individual neurons failed to discriminate the sign of Df when the jamming stimulus had the same field geometry as the signal mimicking the animal's own EOD (Fig. 3). 3. Df magnitudes which evoke strongest JARs, usually 4 to 8 Hz, also induced most vigorous responses in sign-selective neurons (Fig. 5). 4. Behavioral and neuronal thresholds for the detection of small jamming signals were similar. Threshold for sign selectivity was reached when the amplitude ratio of the jamming signal to the EOD mimic, measured near the head surface, was 0.001. This value corresponds to a maximal temporal disparity (a necessary cue for performing a correct JAR) of 1 to 2 microseconds for signals received by the two sides of the body in a transverse jamming field (Fig. 7). 5. The effects of two jamming fields, offered orthogonally to each other, may interact nonlinearly at the behavioral as well as at the neuronal level. A positive Df presented in one field may suppress behavioral and neuronal responses to modulations of the sign of Df in the other field (Fig. 8c).},

  abstract      = {The development, maintenance, and perception of learned vocalizations in songbirds are likely to require auditory neurons that respond selectively to song. Neurons with song-selective responses have been described in several brain nuclei critical to singing, but the mechanisms by which such response properties arise, are modified, and propagate are poorly understood. The lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN) is the output of an anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) essential for learning and maintenance of song, processes dependent on auditory feedback. Although neurons throughout this pathway respond selectively to auditory presentation of the bird's own song, LMAN is the last stage at which responses to this auditory information could be transformed before being transmitted to vocal motor areas, where such responses may influence vocal production. Indeed, previous extracellular studies have indicated that LMAN's auditory selectivity is greater than that at earlier stages of the AFP. To determine whether LMAN local circuitry transforms or simply relays song-related auditory information to vocal control neurons, it is essential to distinguish local from extrinsic contributions to LMAN's auditory selectivity. In vivo intracellular recordings from LMAN projection neurons, coupled with local circuit inactivation, reveal that much of LMAN's song selectivity is supplied by its extrinsic inputs, but selective blockade of GABA receptors indicates that local inhibition is required for the expression of song selectivity. Therefore, LMAN neurons receive highly song-selective information, but LMAN's local circuitry can mask these selective inputs, providing a mechanism for context-dependent auditory feedback.},

However, the functional organization and dynamics of local populations in the auditory cortex have remained largely unknown. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we examined the response profiles and network dynamics of layer 2/3 neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice in response to pure tones. We found that local populations in A1 were highly heterogeneous in the large-scale tonotopic organization. Despite the spatial heterogeneity, the tendency of neurons to respond together (measured as noise correlation) was high on average. This functional organization and high levels of noise correlations are consistent with the existence of partially overlapping cortical subnetworks. Our findings may account for apparent discrepancies between ordered large-scale organization and local heterogeneity.},

  abstract      = {One of the most critical problems we face in the study of biological systems is building accurate statistical descriptions of them. This problem has been particularly challenging because biological systems typically contain large numbers of interacting elements, which precludes the use of standard brute force approaches. Recently, though, several groups have reported that there may be an alternate strategy. The reports show that reliable statistical models can be built without knowledge of all the interactions in a system; instead, pairwise interactions can suffice. These findings, however, are based on the analysis of small subsystems. Here, we ask whether the observations will generalize to systems of realistic size, that is, whether pairwise models will provide reliable descriptions of true biological systems. Our results show that, in most cases, they will not. The reason is that there is a crossover in the predictive power of pairwise models: If the size of the subsystem is below the crossover point, then the results have no predictive power for large systems. If the size is above the crossover point, then the results may have predictive power. This work thus provides a general framework for determining the extent to which pairwise models can be used to predict the behavior of large biological systems. Applied to neural data, the size of most systems studied so far is below the crossover point.},

The present study examined the contribution of spike count and spike timing to the discrimination of stimuli that evoke the same taste quality but are of different chemical composition. Responses to between 3 and 21 repeated presentations of two pairs of quality-matched tastants were recorded from 38 single cells in the NTS of urethane-anesthetized rats. Temporal coding was assessed in 24 cells, most of which were tested with salty and sour tastants, using an information-theoretic approach. Within a given cell, responses to tastants of similar quality were generally closer in magnitude than responses to dissimilar tastants; however, tastants of similar quality often reversed their order of effectiveness across replicate sets of trials. Typically, discrimination between tastants of dissimilar qualities could be made by spike count. Responses to tastants of similar quality typically evoked more similar response magnitudes but were more frequently, and to a proportionally greater degree, distinguishable based on temporal information. Results showed that nearly every taste-responsive NTS cell has the capacity to generate temporal features in evoked spike trains that can be used to distinguish between stimuli of different qualities and chemical compositions.},

  abstract      = {The challenge of building increasingly better models of neural responses to natural stimuli is to accurately estimate the multiple stimulus features that may jointly affect the neural spike probability. The selectivity for combinations of features is thought to be crucial for achieving classical properties of neural responses such as contrast invariance. The joint search for these multiple stimulus features is difficult because estimating spike probability as a multidimensional function of stimulus projections onto candidate relevant dimensions is subject to the curse of dimensionality. An attractive alternative is to search for relevant dimensions sequentially, as in projection pursuit regression. Here we demonstrate using analytic arguments and simulations of model cells that different types of sequential search strategies exhibit systematic biases when used with natural stimuli. Simulations show that joint optimization is feasible for up to three dimensions with current algorithms. When applied to the responses of V1 neurons to natural scenes, models based on three jointly optimized dimensions had better predictive power in a majority of cases compared to dimensions optimized sequentially, with different sequential methods yielding comparable results. Thus, although the curse of dimensionality remains, at least several relevant dimensions can be estimated by joint information maximization.},

  abstract      = {In adult male zebra finches, transecting the vocal nerve causes previously stable (i.e., crystallized) song to slowly degrade, presumably because of the resulting distortion in auditory feedback. How and where distorted feedback interacts with song motor networks to induce this process of song decrystallization remains unknown. The song premotor nucleus HVC is a potential site where auditory feedback signals could interact with song motor commands. Although the forebrain nucleus interface of the nidopallium (NIf) appears to be the primary auditory input to HVC, NIf lesions made in adult zebra finches do not trigger song decrystallization. One possibility is that NIf lesions do not interfere with song maintenance, but do compromise the adult zebra finch's ability to express renewed vocal plasticity in response to feedback perturbations. To test this idea, we bilaterally lesioned NIf and then transected the vocal nerve in adult male zebra finches. We found that bilateral NIf lesions did not prevent nerve section-induced song decrystallization. To test the extent to which the NIf lesions disrupted auditory processing in the song system, we made in vivo extracellular recordings in HVC and a downstream anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) in NIf-lesioned birds. We found strong and selective auditory responses to the playback of the birds' own song persisted in HVC and the AFP following NIf lesions. These findings suggest that auditory inputs to the song system other than NIf, such as the caudal mesopallium, could act as a source of auditory feedback signals to the song motor network.},

Systematic electrode penetrations revealed that there is a functionally distinct region where three classes of directionally selective cells with large receptive fields cluster. This region is anteriorly adjoined to the dorsal two-thirds of MT, has a width of 4-5 mm mediolaterally, and therefore may correspond to the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area (MST), which was previously defined as a MT-recipient zone. One class of cells responded to a straight movement of patterns in the frontoparallel plane with directional selectivity (D cells: 217/422, 51.4\%). The second class of cells selectively responded to an expanding or contracting size change of patterns (S cells: 66/422, 15.7\%). These cells responded neither to a change in width of a slit of any orientation or any length, nor to a change in brightness. The third class of cells responded only to a rotation of patterns in one direction (R cells: 58/422, 13.7\%). A majority of these cells (41/58) responded to the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of patterns in the frontoparallel plane (Rf cells), while the rest responded to a rotation of patterns in depth (Rd cells). We will suggest that these cells acquire the ability to discover whole events of visual motion--i.e., unidirectional straight movement, size change (radial movement), and rotation--by integrating elemental motion information extracted by MT cells. The receptive fields of D, S, and Rf cells can be constructed by converging signals of MT cells, the preferred directions of which are arranged in parallel (D cells), radially (S cells), and circularly (Rf cells). The receptive fields of Rd cells can be constructed, in turn, by the convergence of signals of S cells.},

Patients with lesions of the temporal lobe show marked impairment in this test. In our study, we trained monkeys in a pair-association task using a set of computer-generated paired patterns. We found two types of task-related neurons in the anterior temporal cortex. One type selectively responded to both pictures of the paired associates. The other type, which had the strongest response to one picture during the cue presentation, exhibited increasing activity during the delay period when the associate of that picture was used as a cue. These results provide new evidence that single neurons acquire selectivity for visual patterns through associative learning.

  abstract      = {Spontaneous activity plays an important role in the function of neural circuits. Although many similarities between spontaneous and sensory-evoked neocortical activity have been reported, little is known about consistent differences between them. Here, using simultaneously recorded cortical populations and morphologically identified pyramidal cells, we compare the laminar structure of spontaneous and sensory-evoked population activity in rat auditory cortex. Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively.},

  abstract      = {The effects of behavioral training on early visual representations have been elusive when assessed with firing rates. Learning-induced changes in performance, however, suggest that representations should encompass early cortical stages. Here, we address the question of whether training-induced effects are pertinent to neuronal activity outside the task proper, which is a requirement if subsequent perceptional processes should profit from training. To search for a neuronal signature of training effects beyond firing rates, we measured local field potentials, multiunit and isolated spike activity during passive viewing of previously learned stimulus response associations (S+ and S-) in areas 17/18 and 21a of two alert cats. Evoked potential responses as well as gamma oscillations even during the first 200 msec were found to be stronger for S+ in both areas. Most importantly, the later parts of the response (>200 msec) not only exhibit a highly significant difference in coherent gamma oscillations for S+ and S- both within and across areas, but are also characterized by a pronounced preference in firing rate for S+ in area 21a, whereas primary cortex shows a nonsignificant trend for weaker spike responses. From these results, we conclude that training-induced plasticity occurs in adult visual cortex for behaviorally relevant stimuli by changing primarily the temporal structure of neuronal activity at early stages of cortical processing, whereas later stages of cortical processing express the increased coherence of their input in elevated firing rates.},

Spatially selective attention is critical for perception when more information than can be processed in detail is presented simultaneously at distinct locations. When presented with complex, rapidly changing information, listeners may need to selectively attend to specific times rather than to locations. We present evidence that listeners can direct selective attention to time points that differ by as little as 500 msec, and that doing so improves target detection, affects baseline neural activity preceding stimulus presentation, and modulates auditory evoked potentials at a perceptually early stage. These data demonstrate that attentional modulation of early perceptual processing is temporally precise and that listeners can flexibly allocate temporally selective attention over short intervals, making it a viable mechanism for preferentially processing the most relevant segments in rapidly changing streams.},

Regardless of whether one approaches the problem from an encoding or decoding perspective, the main measures used to study the role of correlations can be derived from a common source: the expansion of the mutual information. Two main formalisms of mutual information expansion have been proposed: the series expansion and the exact breakdown. Here we clarify that these two formalisms have a different representation of autocorrelations, so that even when the total information estimated differs by less than 1\%, individual terms can diverge. More precisely, the series expansion explicitly evaluates the informational contribution of autocorrelations in the count of spikes, that is, count autocorrelations, whereas the exact breakdown does not. We propose a new formalism of mutual information expansion, the Poisson exact breakdown, which introduces Poisson equivalents in order to explicitly evaluate the informational contribution of count autocorrelations with no approximation involved. Because several widely employed manipulations of spike trains, most notably binning and pooling, alter the structure of count autocorrelations, the new formalism can provide a useful general framework for studying the role of correlations in population codes.},

Here, we apply a new nonlinear modeling framework to extracellular data recorded from primary auditory cortex (A1) that enables us to explore how the interplay of excitation and inhibition contributes to the processing of complex natural sounds. The resulting description produces more accurate predictions of observed spike trains than the linear spectrotemporal model, and the properties of excitation and inhibition inferred by the model are furthermore consistent with previous intracellular observations. It can also describe several nonlinear properties of A1 that are not captured by linear models, including intensity tuning and selectivity to sound onsets and offsets. These results thus offer a broader picture of the computational role of excitation and inhibition in A1 and support the hypothesis that their interactions play an important role in the processing of natural auditory stimuli.},

We describe two measures of unit isolation quality, Lratio and Isolation Distance, and evaluate their performance using simulations and tetrode recordings. Both measures quantified how well separated the spikes of one cluster (putative neuron) were from other spikes recorded simultaneously on the same multi-channel electrode. In simulations and tetrode recordings, both Lratio and Isolation Distance discriminated well- and poorly-separated clusters. In data sets from the rodent hippocampus in which neurons were simultaneously recorded intracellularly and extracellularly, values of Isolation Distance and Lratio were related to the correct identification of spikes.},

This perceptual ability is likely subserved by auditory neurons whose spiking responses to individual vocalizations are minimally affected by background sounds. However, auditory neurons that produce background-invariant responses to vocalizations in auditory scenes have not been found. Here, we describe a population of neurons in the zebra finch auditory cortex that represent vocalizations with a sparse code and that maintain their vocalization-like firing patterns in levels of background sound that permit behavioral recognition. These same neurons decrease or stop spiking in levels of background sound that preclude behavioral recognition. In contrast, upstream neurons represent vocalizations with dense and background-corrupted responses. We provide experimental evidence suggesting that sparse coding is mediated by feedforward suppression. Finally, we show through simulations that feedforward inhibition can transform a dense representation of vocalizations into a sparse and background-invariant representation.},

Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

  abstract      = {A key issue in understanding the neural code for an ensemble of neurons is the nature and strength of correlations between neurons and how these correlations are related to the stimulus. The issue is complicated by the fact that there is not a single notion of independence or lack of correlation. We distinguish three kinds: (1) activity independence; (2) conditional independence; and (3) information independence. Each notion is related to an information measure: the information between cells, the information between cells given the stimulus, and the synergy of cells about the stimulus, respectively. We show that these measures form an interrelated framework for evaluating contributions of signal and noise correlations to the joint information conveyed about the stimulus and that at least two of the three measures must be calculated to characterize a population code. This framework is compared with others recently proposed in the literature. In addition, we distinguish questions about how information is encoded by a population of neurons from how that information can be decoded. Although information theory is natural and powerful for questions of encoding, it is not sufficient for characterizing the process of decoding. Decoding fundamentally requires an error measure that quantifies the importance of the deviations of estimated stimuli from actual stimuli. Because there is no a priori choice of error measure, questions about decoding cannot be put on the same level of generality as for encoding.},

Here, we analyze the population code of the retina during naturalistic stimulation and show that the information conveyed by specific multi-neuronal firing patterns can be very different from the sum of the pattern's parts. Synchronous spikes convey more information than either of the participating cells, but almost always less than their sum, making them redundant coding symbols. Surprisingly, patterns of spiking and silence are mostly synergistic - carrying information that is accessible only by observing the whole pattern of activity, rather than its components, and signifying unique features in the stimulus. These results demonstrate that the retina uses a combinatorial code and that the brain can benefit significantly from recognizing multi-neuronal firing patterns. },

This approach will miss codes that rely on concerted patterns of action potentials from many cells. Here we analyze visual signaling in populations of ganglion cells recorded from the isolated salamander retina. These neurons tend to fire synchronously far more frequently than expected by chance. We present an efficient algorithm to identify what groups of cells cooperate in this way. Such groups can include up to seven or more neurons and may account for more than 50\% of all the spikes recorded from the retina. These firing patterns represent specific messages about the visual stimulus that differ significantly from what one would derive by single-cell analysis.},

  abstract      = {It has been suggested that ``call-selective'' neurons may play an important role in the encoding of vocalizations in primary auditory cortex (A1). For example, marmoset A1 neurons often respond more vigorously to natural than to time-reversed twitter calls, although the spectral energy distribution in the natural and time-reversed signals is the same. Neurons recorded in cat A1, in contrast, showed no such selectivity for natural marmoset calls. To investigate whether call selectivity in A1 can arise purely as a result of auditory experience, we recorded responses to marmoset calls in A1 of naive ferrets, as well as in ferrets that had been trained to recognize these natural marmoset calls. We found that training did not induce call selectivity for the trained vocalizations in A1. However, although ferret A1 neurons were not call selective, they efficiently represented the vocalizations through temporal pattern codes, and trained animals recognized marmoset twitters with a high degree of accuracy. These temporal patterns needed to be analyzed at timescales of 10-50 ms to ensure efficient decoding. Training led to a substantial increase in the amount of information transmitted by these temporal discharge patterns, but the fundamental nature of the temporal pattern code remained unaltered. These results emphasize the importance of temporal discharge patterns and cast doubt on the functional significance of call-selective neurons in the processing of animal communication sounds at the level of A1.},

The behavioural aspects of such perceptual learning are well documented, especially in the visual system. Specificity for stimulus attributes clearly implicates an early cortical site, where receptive fields retain fine selectivity for these attributes; however, the neuronal correlates of a simple visual discrimination task remained unidentified. Here we report electrophysiological correlates in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys for learning orientation identification. We link the behavioural improvement in this type of learning to an improved neuronal performance of trained compared to naive neurons. Improved long-term neuronal performance resulted from changes in the characteristics of orientation tuning of individual neurons. More particularly, the slope of the orientation tuning curve that was measured at the trained orientation increased only for the subgroup of trained neurons most likely to code the orientation identified by the monkey. No modifications of the tuning curve were observed for orientations for which the monkey had not been trained. Thus training induces a specific and efficient increase in neuronal sensitivity in V1.},

They underlie the derivation of the computational principles that govern sensory processing and the generation of perception. Despite their intuitive explanatory power, the functions of and rules for organizing maps and their plasticity are not well understood. Some puzzles of auditory cortical map organization are that few complete receptor maps are available and that even fewer computational maps are known beyond primary cortical areas. Neuroanatomical evidence suggests equally organized connectional patterns throughout the cortical hierarchy that might underlie map stability. Here, we consider the implications of auditory cortical map organization and its plasticity and evaluate the complementary role of maps in representation and computation from an auditory perspective.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Humans can easily restore a speech signal that is temporally masked by an interfering sound (e.g., a cough masking parts of a word in a conversation), and listeners have the illusion that the speech continues through the interfering sound. This perceptual restoration for human speech is affected by prior experience. Here we provide evidence for perceptual restoration in complex vocalizations of a songbird that are acquired by vocal learning in a similar way as humans learn their language. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: European starlings were trained in a same/different paradigm to report salient differences between successive sounds. The birds' response latency for discriminating between a stimulus pair is an indicator for the salience of the difference, and these latencies can be used to evaluate perceptual distances using multi-dimensional scaling. For familiar motifs the birds showed a large perceptual distance if discriminating between song motifs that were muted for brief time periods and complete motifs. If the muted periods were filled with noise, the perceptual distance was reduced. For unfamiliar motifs no such difference was observed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that starlings are able to perceptually restore partly masked sounds and, similarly to humans, rely on prior experience. They may be a suitable model to study the mechanism underlying experience-dependent perceptual restoration.},

  abstract      = {Although understanding the processing of natural sounds is an important goal in auditory neuroscience, relatively little is known about the neural coding of these sounds. Recently we demonstrated that the spectral temporal receptive field (STRF), a description of the stimulus-response function of auditory neurons, could be derived from responses to arbitrary ensembles of complex sounds including vocalizations. In this study, we use this method to investigate the auditory processing of natural sounds in the birdsong system. We obtain neural responses from several regions of the songbird auditory forebrain to a large ensemble of bird songs and use these data to calculate the STRFs, which are the best linear model of the spectral-temporal features of sound to which auditory neurons respond. We find that these neurons respond to a wide variety of features in songs ranging from simple tonal components to more complex spectral-temporal structures such as frequency sweeps and multi-peaked frequency stacks. We quantify spectral and temporal characteristics of these features by extracting several parameters from the STRFs. Moreover, we assess the linearity versus nonlinearity of encoding by quantifying the quality of the predictions of the neural responses to songs obtained using the STRFs. Our results reveal successively complex functional stages of song analysis by neurons in the auditory forebrain. When we map the properties of auditory forebrain neurons, as characterized by the STRF parameters, onto conventional anatomical subdivisions of the auditory forebrain, we find that although some properties are shared across different subregions, the distribution of several parameters is suggestive of hierarchical processing.},

Here we reexamine these assumptions in networks of spiking neurons by using orientation selectivity as an example. We compare two principal classes of model: one in which the tuning curves are sharpened through cortical lateral interactions, and one in which they are not. We report that sharpening through lateral interactions does not improve population codes but, on the contrary, leads to a severe loss of information. In addition, the sharpening models generate complicated codes that rely extensively on pairwise correlations. Our study generates several experimental predictions that can be used to distinguish between these two classes of model.},

We have now used numerical simulations to try to understand how neural signals in area MT support psychophysical decisions. We developed a model that pools neuronal responses drawn from our physiological data set and compares average responses in different pools to produce psychophysical decisions. The structure of the model allows us to assess the relationship between ``neuronal'' input signals and simulated psychophysical performance using the same methods we have applied to real experimental data. We sought to reconcile three experimental observations: psychophysical performance (threshold sensitivity to motion stimuli embedded in noise), a trial-by-trial covariation between the neural response and the monkey's choices, and a modest correlation between pairs of MT neurons in their variable responses to identical visual stimuli. Our results can be most accurately simulated if psychophysical decisions are based on pools of at least 100 weakly correlated sensory neurons. The neurons composing the pools must include a broader range of sensitivities than we encountered in our MT recordings, presumably because of the inclusion of neurons whose optimal stimulus is different from the one being discriminated. Central sources of noise degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of the pooled signal, but this degradation is relatively small compared with the noise typically carried by single cortical neurons. This suggests that our monkeys base near-threshold psychophysical judgments on signals carried by populations of weakly interacting neurons; these populations include many neurons that are not tuned optimally for the particular stimuli being discriminated.},

  abstract      = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a ``high-input regime'' in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.},

  abstract      = {A key discovery that has emerged from studies of the vocal system in songbirds is that neurons in these regions respond preferentially to playback of the bird's own song (BOS). This BOS selectivity is not a general property of neurons in primary and secondary auditory forebrain regions, field L and caudolateral mesopallium (CLM). Moreover, anatomical studies have been unable to conclusively define a direct projection from field L and/or CLM to HVC, a central structure for integrating sensory and motor information in the vocal system. To examine the communication between these regions, we used simultaneous dual-electrode recording in anesthetized male zebra finches and cross-correlation analysis to estimate the functional connectivity between auditory areas, field L and CLM, and HVC. We found that >or=18\% of neurons in field L and 33\% of neurons in CLM are functionally connected to HVC, most with auditory forebrain leading-HVC latencies ranging from 0.5 to 15 ms. These results indicate that field L and CLM communicate extensively with HVC through both direct and indirect anatomical connections. To further explore the role of the auditory forebrain cells that are functionally connected with HVC, we assessed their responsiveness and selectivity for a variety of natural and synthetic auditory stimuli. We found that field L and CLM neurons that are functionally connected to HVC exhibit generic auditory forebrain properties including the lack of BOS selectivity. This finding puts further constraints on the neural architecture and the nature of the nonlinearity that leads to BOS-selective auditory responses in the vocal control nuclei.},

Assuming that only the first-order statistics of the neuronal responses are tuned to the stimulus, these studies have shown that n the presence of correlations, similar to those observed experimentally in cortical ensembles of neurons, the amount of information in the population is limited, yielding nonzero error levels even in the limit of infinitely large populations of neurons.

Here, we argue instead that stream formation depends primarily on temporal coherence between responses that encode various features of a sound source. Furthermore, we postulate that only when attention is directed towards a particular feature (e.g. pitch) do all other temporally coherent features of that source (e.g. timbre and location) become bound together as a stream that is segregated from the incoherent features of other sources.},

Values of time constants and gain of the components in this model were chosen to approximate (with least-squared deviation) experimentally measured first-order frequency responses. In the experiments used for the analysis, the visual stimulus was a sine grating modulated by a sum of sinusoids. 3. For both X cells and Y cells, the over-all gain and the time constants of the cascade of low pass filters were insensitive to contrast. 4. In all cells, the gain-bandwidth product of the negative feed-back loop was markedly increased with increasing contrast. 5. The effect of stimulation in the periphery of the receptive fields on the first-order frequency response to a centrally placed spot was identical to the effect of increasing contrast in the grating experiments. In all cases, the gain-bandwidth product of the negative feed-back loop was the only model parameter affected by peripheral stimulation. 6. A similar effect of non-linear summation was investigated for two bars located in the receptive field periphery. 7.

We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of a high-dimensional stimulus space, but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of the stimulus onto low-dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map the neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions. These ideas are illustrated in simulations on model visual and auditory neurons responding to natural scenes and sounds, respectively.},

In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.},

  abstract      = {A common complaint among listeners with hearing loss (HL) is that they have difficulty communicating in common social settings. This article reviews how normal-hearing listeners cope in such settings, especially how they focus attention on a source of interest. Results of experiments with normal-hearing listeners suggest that the ability to selectively attend depends on the ability to analyze the acoustic scene and to form perceptual auditory objects properly. Unfortunately, sound features important for auditory object formation may not be robustly encoded in the auditory periphery of HL listeners. In turn, impaired auditory object formation may interfere with the ability to filter out competing sound sources. Peripheral degradations are also likely to reduce the salience of higher-order auditory cues such as location, pitch, and timbre, which enable normal-hearing listeners to select a desired sound source out of a sound mixture. Degraded peripheral processing is also likely to increase the time required to form auditory objects and focus selective attention so that listeners with HL lose the ability to switch attention rapidly (a skill that is particularly important when trying to participate in a lively conversation). Finally, peripheral deficits may interfere with strategies that normal-hearing listeners employ in complex acoustic settings, including the use of memory to fill in bits of the conversation that are missed. Thus, peripheral hearing deficits are likely to cause a number of interrelated problems that challenge the ability of HL listeners to communicate in social settings requiring selective attention.},

However, it remains unclear how synchronized firing affects the large-scale patterns of activity and redundancy of visual signals in a complete population of neurons. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of retinal ganglion cells in primate retina, and examined synchronized firing in completely sampled populations of approximately 50-100 ON-parasol cells, which form a major projection to the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Synchronized firing in pairs of cells was a subset of a much larger pattern of activity that exhibited local, isotropic spatial properties. However, a simple model based solely on interactions between adjacent cells reproduced 99\% of the spatial structure and scale of synchronized firing. No more than 20\% of the variability in firing of an individual cell was predictable from the activity of its neighbors. These results held both for spontaneous firing and in the presence of independent visual modulation of the firing of each cell. In sum, large-scale synchronized firing in the entire population of ON-parasol cells appears to reflect simple neighbor interactions, rather than a unique visual signal or a highly redundant coding scheme.},

  abstract      = {Current understanding of many neural circuits is limited by our ability to explore the vast number of potential interactions between different cells. We present a new approach that dramatically reduces the complexity of this problem. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings were used to measure electrical activity in nearly complete, regularly spaced mosaics of several hundred ON and OFF parasol retinal ganglion cells in macaque monkey retina. Parasol cells exhibited substantial pairwise correlations, as has been observed in other species, indicating functional connectivity. However, pairwise measurements alone are insufficient to determine the prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, which would be predicted from widely diverging common inputs and have been hypothesized to convey distinct visual messages to the brain. The number of possible multi-neuron firing patterns is far too large to study exhaustively, but this problem may be circumvented if two simple rules of connectivity can be established: (1) multi-cell firing patterns arise from multiple pairwise interactions, and (2) interactions are limited to adjacent cells in the mosaic. Using maximum entropy methods from statistical mechanics, we show that pairwise and adjacent interactions accurately accounted for the structure and prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, explaining approximately 98\% of the departures from statistical independence in parasol cells and approximately 99\% of the departures that were reproducible in repeated measurements. This approach provides a way to define limits on the complexity of network interactions and thus may be relevant for probing the function of many neural circuits.},

A related work (Kennel, Shlens, Abarbanel, \& Chichilnisky, 2005) demonstrated how to reliably estimate, with a Bayesian confidence interval, the entropy rate from a discrete, observed time series. We extend this method to measure the rate of novel information that a neural spike train encodes about a stimulus--the average and specific mutual information rates. Our estimator makes few assumptions about the underlying neural dynamics, shows excellent performance in experimentally relevant regimes, and uniquely provides confidence intervals bounding the range of information rates compatible with the observed spike train. We validate this estimator with simulations of spike trains and highlight how stimulus parameters affect its convergence in bias and variance. Finally, we apply these ideas to a recording from a guinea pig retinal ganglion cell and compare results to a simple linear decoder.},

  abstract      = {Neurons in primary auditory cortex (AI) in the ferret (Mustela putorius) that are well described by their spectrotemporal response field (STRF) are found also to have a distinctive property that we call temporal symmetry. For temporally symmetric neurons, every temporal cross-section of the STRF (impulse response) is given by the same function of time, except for a scaling and a Hilbert rotation. This property held in 85\% of neurons (123 out of 145) recorded from awake animals and in 96\% of neurons (70 out of 73) recorded from anesthetized animals. This property of temporal symmetry is highly constraining for possible models of functional neural connectivity within and into AI. We find that the simplest models of functional thalamic input, from the ventral medial geniculate body (MGB), into the entry layers of AI are ruled out because they are incompatible with the constraints of the observed temporal symmetry. This is also the case for the simplest models of functional intracortical connectivity. Plausible models that do generate temporal symmetry, from both thalamic and intracortical inputs, are presented. In particular, we propose that two specific characteristics of the thalamocortical interface may be responsible. The first is a temporal mismatch between the fast dynamics of the thalamus and the slow responses of the cortex. The second is that all thalamic inputs into a cortical module (or a cluster of cells) must be restricted to one point of entry (or one cell in the cluster). This latter property implies a lack of correlated horizontal interactions across cortical modules during the STRF measurements. The implications of these insights in the auditory system, and comparisons with similar properties in the visual system, are explored.},

  abstract      = {One of the basic functions of the cerebral cortex is the analysis and representation of relations among the components of sensory and motor patterns. It is proposed that the cortex applies two complementary strategies to cope with the combinatorial problem posed by the astronomical number of possible relations: (i) the analysis and representation of frequently occurring, behaviorally relevant relations by groups of cells with fixed but broadly tuned response properties; and (ii) the dynamic association of these cells into functionally coherent assemblies. Feedforward connections and reciprocal associative connections, respectively, are thought to underlie these two operations. The architectures of both types of connections are susceptible to experience-dependent modifications during development, but they become fixed in the adult. As development proceeds, feedforward connections also appear to lose much of their functional plasticity, whereas the synapses of the associative connections retain a high susceptibility to use-dependent modifications. The reduced plasticity of feedforward connections is probably responsible for the invariance of cognitive categories acquired early in development. The persistent adaptivity of reciprocal connections is a likely substrate for the ability to generate representations for new perceptual objects and motor patterns throughout life.},

  abstract      = {Owing to the limited dynamic range of a neuron's output, neural circuits are faced with a trade-off between encoding the full range of their inputs and resolving gradations among those inputs. For example, the ambient light level varies daily over more than nine orders of magnitude, whereas the firing rate of optic nerve fibres spans less than two. This discrepancy is alleviated by light adaptation: as the mean intensity increases, the retina becomes proportionately less sensitive. However, image statistics other than the mean intensity also vary drastically during routine visual processing. Theory predicts that an efficient visual encoder should adapt its strategy not only to the mean, but to the full shape of the intensity distribution. Here we report that retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, adapt to both image contrast-the range of light intensities-and to spatial correlations within the scene, even at constant mean intensity. The adaptation occurs on a scale of seconds, one hundred times more slowly than the immediate light response, and involves 2-5-fold changes in the firing rate. It is mediated within the retinal network: two independent sites of modulation after the photoreceptor cells appear to be involved. Our results demonstrate a remarkable plasticity in retinal processing that may contribute to the contrast adaptation of human vision.},

Attempts to reveal such neural information flow have been made using linear computational methods, but neural interactions are known to be nonlinear. Here, we demonstrate that a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) inference algorithm we originally developed to infer nonlinear transcriptional regulatory networks from gene expression data collected with microarrays is also successful at inferring nonlinear neural information flow networks from electrophysiology data collected with microelectrode arrays. The inferred networks we recover from the songbird auditory pathway are correctly restricted to a subset of known anatomical paths, are consistent with timing of the system, and reveal both the importance of reciprocal feedback in auditory processing and greater information flow to higher-order auditory areas when birds hear natural as opposed to synthetic sounds. A linear method applied to the same data incorrectly produces networks with information flow to non-neural tissue and over paths known not to exist. To our knowledge, this study represents the first biologically validated demonstration of an algorithm to successfully infer neural information flow networks.},

Female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) prefer males with long-bout songs over males with short-bout songs, and show higher expression of the immediate early gene (IEG) ZENK in the auditory forebrain when exposed to long-bout songs than when exposed to short-bout songs. We exposed female starlings to a short-day photoperiod for one of three durations and then, on an increased photophase, exposed them to one week of long-bout or short-bout song experience. We then examined their IEG response to novel long-bout versus novel short-bout songs by quantifying ZENK protein in two song-processing areas: the caudo-medial hyperstriatum ventrale and the caudo-medial neostriatum. ZENK expression in both areas increased with tenure on short-day photoperiods, suggesting that short days sensitize females to song. The ZENK response bias toward long-bout songs was greater in females with long-bout experience than in females with short-bout experience, indicating that the forebrain response bias toward a preferred trait depends on recent experience with that category of trait. This surprising level of neuroplasticity is immediately relevant to the natural history and fitness of the organism, and may underlie a mechanism for optimizing mate-choice criteria amidst locally variable distributions of secondary sexual characteristics.},

  abstract      = {Choice of a particular mate phenotype may arise out of experience with the very phenotypes under consideration. Female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) prefer males that sing predominantly long-bout songs over males that sing predominantly short-bout songs, and thus, song-bout length is a phenotypic parameter instrumental in releasing the female's mate choice. The preferred long-bout songs induce higher expression of the immediate early gene (IEG) ZENK in the female auditory telencephalon than short-bout songs do, but this sensitivity to song length depends on the female's recent song experience. Here, we compared the experience-dependent modulation of ZENK with that of another IEG, FOS, and report that ZENK and FOS expression in the caudomedial mesopallium and caudomedial nidopallium show different modulation properties that complement natural variation in song-bout length. As reported previously, ZENK expression was greater in response to novel long-bout than to novel short-bout songs following a 1-week experience with long-bout but not short-bout songs. In contrast, FOS expression was greater in response to novel long-bout than to novel short-bout songs following a 1-week experience with short-bout but not long-bout songs. Thus, the ZENK and FOS signaling pathways are made sensitive to variation in song length by experiences with songs at opposite ends of the starling song-variation continuum, suggesting the presence of complementary neural systems made sensitive in register with the natural axis of phenotypic variation fundamental to the female's mate choice.},

  abstract      = {Neuronal representations of external events are often distributed across large populations of cells. We study the effect of correlated noise on the accuracy of these neuronal population codes. Our main question is whether the inherent error in the population code can be suppressed by increasing the size of the population N in the presence of correlated noise. We address this issue using a model of a population of neurons that are broadly tuned to an angular variable in two dimensions. The fluctuations in the neuronal activities are modeled as Gaussian noises with pairwise correlations that decay exponentially with the difference between the preferred angles of the correlated cells. We assume that the system is broadly tuned, which means that both the correlation length and the width of the tuning curves of the mean responses span a substantial fraction of the entire system length. The performance of the system is measured by the Fisher information (FI), which bounds its estimation error. By calculating the FI in the limit of a large N, we show that positive correlations decrease the estimation capability of the network, relative to the uncorrelated population. The information capacity saturates to a finite value as the number of cells in the population grows. In contrast, negative correlations substantially increase the information capacity of the neuronal population. These results are supplemented by the effect of correlations on the mutual information of the system. Our analysis provides an estimate of the effective number of statistically independent degrees of freedom, denoted N-eff, that a large correlated system can have. According to our theory N-eff remains finite in the limit of a large N. Estimating the parameters of the correlations and tuning curves from experimental data in some cortical areas that code for angles, we predict that the number of effective degrees of freedom embedded in localized populations in these areas is less than or of the order of approximate to 10(2).},

To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further.},

We investigated the synchronous firing of pairs of neurons in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) of three monkeys trained to switch attention between a visual task and a tactile discrimination task. We found that most neuron pairs in SII cortex fired synchronously and, furthermore, that the degree of synchrony was affected by the monkey's attentional state. In the monkey performing the most difficult task, 35\% of neuron pairs that fired synchronously changed their degree of synchrony when the monkey switched attention between the tactile and visual tasks. Synchrony increased in 80\% and decreased in 20\% of neuron pairs affected by attention.},

  abstract      = {How interactions between neurons relate to tuned neural responses is a longstanding question in systems neuroscience. Here we use statistical modeling and simultaneous multi-electrode recordings to explore the relationship between these interactions and tuning curves in six different brain areas. We find that, in most cases, functional interactions between neurons provide an explanation of spiking that complements and, in some cases, surpasses the influence of canonical tuning curves. Modeling functional interactions improves both encoding and decoding accuracy by accounting for noise correlations and features of the external world that tuning curves fail to capture. In cortex, modeling coupling alone allows spikes to be predicted more accurately than tuning curve models based on external variables. These results suggest that statistical models of functional interactions between even relatively small numbers of neurons may provide a useful framework for examining neural coding.},

  abstract      = {A central question in neuroscience is how interactions between neurons give rise to behavior. In many electrophysiological experiments, the activity of a set of neurons is recorded while sensory stimuli or movement tasks are varied. Tools that aim to reveal underlying interactions between neurons from such data can be extremely useful. Traditionally, neuroscientists have studied these interactions using purely descriptive statistics (cross-correlograms or joint peri-stimulus time histograms). However, the interpretation of such data is often difficult, particularly as the number of recorded neurons grows. Recent research suggests that model-based, maximum likelihood methods can improve these analyses. In addition to estimating neural interactions, application of these techniques has improved decoding of external variables, created novel interpretations of existing electrophysiological data, and may provide new insight into how the brain represents information.},

  abstract      = {Stimulus-evoked oscillatory synchronization of neural assemblies has been described in the olfactory and visual systems of several vertebrates and invertebrates. In locusts, information about odour identity is contained in the timing of action potentials in an oscillatory population response, suggesting that oscillations may reflect a common reference for messages encoded in time. Although the stimulus-evoked oscillatory phenomenon is reliable, its roles in sensation, perception, memory formation and pattern recognition remain to be demonstrated--a task requiring a behavioural paradigm. Using honeybees, we now demonstrate that odour encoding involves, as it does in locusts, the oscillatory synchronization of assemblies of projection neurons and that this synchronization is also selectively abolished by picrotoxin, an antagonist of the GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor. By using a behavioural learning paradigm, we show that picrotoxin-induced desynchronization impairs the discrimination of molecularly similar odorants, but not that of dissimilar odorants. It appears, therefore, that oscillatory synchronization of neuronal assemblies is functionally relevant, and essential for fine sensory discrimination. This suggests that oscillatory synchronization and the kind of temporal encoding it affords provide an additional dimension by which the brain could segment spatially overlapping stimulus representations.},

  abstract      = {The auditory system consists of the ascending and descending (corticofugal) systems. The corticofugal system forms multiple feedback loops. Repetitive acoustic or auditory cortical electric stimulation activates the cortical neural net and the corticofugal system and evokes cortical plastic changes as well as subcortical plastic changes. These changes are short-term and are specific to the properties of the acoustic stimulus or electrically stimulated cortical neurons. These plastic changes are modulated by the neuromodulatory system. When the acoustic stimulus becomes behaviorally relevant to the animal through auditory fear conditioning or when the cortical electric stimulation is paired with an electric stimulation of the cholinergic basal forebrain, the cortical plastic changes become larger and long-term, whereas the subcortical changes stay short-term, although they also become larger. Acetylcholine plays an essential role in augmenting the plastic changes and in producing long-term cortical changes. The corticofugal system has multiple functions. One of the most important functions is the improvement and adjustment (reorganization) of subcortical auditory signal processing for cortical signal processing.},

When the sound becomes significant to the animal through conditioning (associative learning), the changes are augmented and the cortical changes become long-term. There are two types of reorganizations: expanded reorganization resulting from centripetal shifts in tuning curves of neurons toward the values of the parameters characterizing a sound and compressed reorganization resulting from centrifugal shifts in tuning curves of neurons away from these values. The two types of reorganizations are based on a single mechanism consisting of two components: facilitation and inhibition.},

Stimuli falling in the receptive field surround can influence the neuronal response evoked by a stimulus appearing within the classical receptive field. Such modulation by task-irrelevant distracters may degrade the target-related neuronal signal. We therefore examined whether directing attention to a target stimulus can reduce the influence of task-irrelevant distracters on neuronal response. We find that in area V4 attention to a stimulus within a neuron's receptive field filters out a large fraction of the suppression induced by distracters appearing in the surround. When attention is instead directed to the surround stimulus, suppression is increased, thereby filtering out part of the neuronal response to the irrelevant distracter positioned within the receptive field. These findings demonstrate that attention modulates the neural mechanisms that give rise to center-surround interactions.},

To further characterize the functional structure of area TE, we quantitatively analyzed various aspects of the visual responses of closely located neurons by applying multiple single-unit recording techniques in anesthetized monkeys. Examination of the visual responses elicited with a large, predetermined set of visual stimuli confirmed previous findings that nearby neurons, on average, exhibited positively correlated preferences for a set of visual stimuli. Nearby neurons also tended to be similar in their receptive-field organization and contrast-polarity preference. In contrast, no correlation was found in the size tuning of neighboring neurons. Pooling or subtraction of activities between a pair of nearby neurons was shown to improve stimulus discriminability, if the neuron pair had positively or negatively correlated stimulus preferences, respectively. These results indicate that nearby TE neurons share some aspects of stimulus preference, but their response selectivity differ in other aspects. Both pooling and subtraction between nearby neurons can reduce across-trial response variability, if these decoding strategies are applied to appropriate neuronal pools.},

  abstract      = {Multineuron firing patterns are often observed, yet are predicted to be rare by models that assume independent firing. To explain these correlated network states, two groups recently applied a second-order maximum entropy model that used only observed firing rates and pairwise interactions as parameters (Schneidman et al., 2006; Shlens et al., 2006). Interestingly, with these minimal assumptions they predicted 90-99\% of network correlations. If generally applicable, this approach could vastly simplify analyses of complex networks. However, this initial work was done largely on retinal tissue, and its applicability to cortical circuits is mostly unknown. This work also did not address the temporal evolution of correlated states. To investigate these issues, we applied the model to multielectrode data containing spontaneous spikes or local field potentials from cortical slices and cultures. The model worked slightly less well in cortex than in retina, accounting for 88 +/- 7\% (mean +/- SD) of network correlations. In addition, in 8 of 13 preparations, the observed sequences of correlated states were significantly longer than predicted by concatenating states from the model. This suggested that temporal dependencies are a common feature of cortical network activity, and should be considered in future models. We found a significant relationship between strong pairwise temporal correlations and observed sequence length, suggesting that pairwise temporal correlations may allow the model to be extended into the temporal domain. We conclude that although a second-order maximum entropy model successfully predicts correlated states in cortical networks, it should be extended to account for temporal correlations observed between states.},

  abstract      = {In layer IV of rat somatosensory cortex, barrel circuitry is highly sensitive to thalamic population firing rates during the first few milliseconds of the whisker-evoked response. This sensitivity of barrel neurons to thalamic firing synchrony was inferred previously from analysis of simulated barrel circuitry and from single-unit recordings performed one at a time. In this study, we investigate stimulus-dependent synchronous activity in the thalamic ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) using the more direct approach of local field potential (LFP) recording. We report that thalamic barreloid neurons generate larger magnitude LFP responses to principal versus adjacent whiskers, to preferred versus nonpreferred movement directions, and to high- versus low-velocity/acceleration deflections. Responses were better predicted by acceleration than velocity, and they were insensitive to the final amplitude of whisker deflection. Importantly, reliable and robust stimulus/response relationships were found only for the initial 1.2-7.5 ms of the thalamic LFP response, reflecting arrival of afferent information from the brain stem. Later components of the thalamic response, which are likely to coincide with arrival of inhibitory inputs from the thalamic reticular nucleus and excitatory inputs from the barrel cortex itself, are variable and poorly predicted by stimulus parameters. Together with previous results, these findings underscore a critical role for thalamic firing synchrony in the encoding of small but rapidly changing perturbations of specific whiskers in particular directions.},

  abstract      = {We propose a rigorous definition for the term temporal encoding as it is applied to schemes for the representation of information within patterns of neuronal action potentials, and distinguish temporal encoding schemes from those based on window-averaged mean rate encoding. The definition relies on the identification of an encoding time window, defined as the duration of a neuron's spike train assumed to correspond to a single symbol in the neural code. The duration of the encoding time window is dictated by the time scale of the information being encoded. We distinguish between the concepts of the encoding time window and the integration time window, the latter of which is defined as the duration of a stimulus signal that affects the response of the neuron. We note that the duration of the encoding and integration windows might be significantly different. We also present objective, experimentally assessable criteria for identifying neurons and neuronal ensembles that utilize temporal encoding to any significant extent. The definitions and criteria are made rigorous within the contexts of several commonly used analytical approaches, including the stimulus reconstruction analysis technique. Several examples are presented to illustrate the distinctions between and relative capabilities of rate encoding and temporal encoding schemes. We also distinguish our usage of temporal encoding from the term temporal coding, which is commonly used in reference to the representation of information about the timing of events by rate encoding schemes.},

  abstract      = {1. The stimulus/response properties of four identified primary sensory interneurons in the cricket cercal sensory system were studied using electrophysiological techniques. These four cells are thought to represent a functionally discrete subunit of the cercal system: they are the only cells that encode information about stimulus direction to higher centers for low intensity stimuli. Previous studies characterized the quantity of information encoded by these cells about the direction of air currents in the horizontal plane. In the experiments reported here, we characterized the quantity and quality of information encoded in the cells' elicited responses about the dynamics of air current waveforms presented at their optimal stimulus directions. The total sample set included 22 cells. 2. This characterization was achieved by determining the cells' frequency sensitivities and encoding accuracy using the methods of stochastic systems analysis and information theory. The specific approach used for the analysis was the ``stimulus reconstruction'' technique in which a functional expansion was derived to transform the observed spike train responses into the optimal estimate (i.e., ``reconstruction'') of the actual stimulus. A novel derivation of the crucial equations is presented. The reverse approach is compared with the more traditional forward analysis, in which an expansion is derived that transforms the stimulus to a prediction of the spike train response. Important aspects of the application of these analytical approaches are considered. 3. All four interneurons were found to have identical frequency tuning, as assessed by the accuracy with which different frequency components of stimulus waveforms could be reconstructed with a linear expansion. The interneurons encoded significant information about stimulus frequencies between 5 and 80 Hz, which peak sensitivities at approximately 15 Hz. 4. All four interneurons were found to have identical stimulus/response latencies. The mean latency between a stimulus component and the corresponding elicited spike was 17 ms. All four interneurons also had identical integration times. The integration time, measured by the duration of stimulus, which could affect the probability of spiking, was approximately 50 ms. 5. The accuracy of the encoding can be expressed as a signal-to-noise ratio, where the noise is a scaled difference between the original signal and the best estimate of the signal. Peak signal-to-noise ratios of approximately 1 were obtained for the cells across all stimulus power levels, using only the linear expansion term. Analysis of the data indicated that the consideration of second-order nonlinear transformations of the stimulus would not have increased the calculated encoding accuracy. 6. The encoding accuracy also can be expressed in the information theoretic units of bits/second, which characterizes the information transmission rate of the cell. Bits/second values varied between 10 and 80 for the 22 different cells in our experimental set. The information rate values were highly correlated with the mean spike rates of the interneurons, but were not correlated with the stimulus power levels. However, normalizing the absolute information rates by the mean spike rate in each case yielded a measure of bits/spike that was remarkably invariant across all experiments. The measured bits/spike rate was approximately 1 for all experiments. This result is discussed in the context of recent theoretical studies on optimal encoding. 7. Although the dynamic sensitivities of the four interneurons were identical, their directional sensitivities are known to be orthogonal. Thus the cells are complementary to one another from a functional standpoint: whereas a particular cell will be insensitive to air currents from some directions, one or more of the other three cells will be sensitive to stimuli from those directions...},

  abstract      = {1. Principles of information theory were used to calculate the limit of accuracy achievable by a subset of the wind-sensitive primary interneurons in the cricket cercal sensory system. For these calculations, an ensemble of four neurons was treated as an information channel, which encoded the direction of air-current stimuli for a defined range of air-current velocities. The specific information theoretic parameter that was calculated was the ``transin-formation'' or ``mutual information'' between the air-current directions and the neuronal spike trains, which were characterized in the preceding report. Under the assumptions used for these calculations, the ensemble of four interneurons was demonstrated to be capable of encoding between 4.2 and 3.5 bits of information about wind direction. This corresponds to an average directional accuracy of 4.7 and 7.7 degrees, respectively. 2. The same principles were applied to estimate the extent to which any variation in the width of the tuning curves would affect the transfer of information. As the widths of simulated tuning curves were varied, the mean ensemble accuracy showed a clear global maximum. This maximum corresponds to tuning curves widths of 110 degrees wide (at half maximum), which was remarkably close to the actual mean widths of the tuning curves observed in the cricket of 130 degrees. 3. The effect of varying the parametric ``spacing'' of the tuning curves within the stimulus range was also examined through a series of simulations. The configuration allowing the maximum information transfer corresponded to equal spacing of the tuning curves around the stimulus range (i.e., 90 degrees separation of peak sensitivity points). This theoretically optimum spacing corresponded exactly to the values observed in the experiments presented in the preceding report. 4. These simulations also showed that the degradation in the accuracy resulting from a shift in the tuning-curve spacing would depend on the plasticity of the higher order decoder of directional information. If there were no plasticity in the interneurons making up the higher order decoder, then the accuracy would be degraded by 50\% for a mean tuning-curve shift of only 3.5 degrees. However, if the higher order decoding network were capable of being reoptimized to any arbitrary shift in tuning curves, the degradation in attainable accuracy would be much less severe as shifts of up to 10 degrees would result in virtually no degradation in the accuracy. 5. From these results, two general conclusions can be drawn about the coding of specific stimulus parameters by arrays of sensory cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract      = {The stimulus-response function of many visual and auditory neurons has been described by a spatial-temporal receptive field (STRF), a linear model that for mathematical reasons has until recently been estimated with the reverse correlation method, using simple stimulus ensembles such as white noise. Such stimuli, however, often do not effectively activate high-level sensory neurons, which may be optimized to analyze natural sounds and images. We show that it is possible to overcome the simple-stimulus limitation and then use this approach to calculate the STRFs of avian auditory forebrain neurons from an ensemble of birdsongs. We find that in many cases the STRFs derived using natural sounds are strikingly different from the STRFs that we obtained using an ensemble of random tone pips. When we compare these two models by assessing their predictions of neural response to the actual data, we find that the STRFs obtained from natural sounds are superior. Our results show that the STRF model is an incomplete description of response properties of nonlinear auditory neurons, but that linear receptive fields are still useful models for understanding higher level sensory processing, as long as the STRFs are estimated from the responses to relevant complex stimuli.},

These two quantitative frameworks are often assumed to be equivalent. For example, higher mutual information is said to correspond to improved performance of an ideal observer in a stimulus estimation task. To the contrary, drawing on and extending previous results, we show that five information-theoretic quantities (entropy, response-conditional entropy, specific information, equivocation, and mutual information) violate this assumption. More positively, we show how these information measures can be used to calculate upper and lower bounds on ideal observer performance, and vice versa. The results show that the mathematical resources of ideal observer analysis are preferable to information theory for evaluating performance in a stimulus discrimination task. We also discuss the applicability of information theory to questions that ideal observer analysis cannot address.},

  abstract      = {1. The possibility of temporal encoding in the spike trains of single neurons recorded in the temporal lobe visual cortical areas of rhesus macaques was analyzed with the use of principal component and information theory analyses of smoothed spike trains. The neurons analyzed had responses selective for faces. 2. Provided that a correction was applied to earlier methods of principal component analysis used for neuronal spike trains, it was shown that the first principal component provides by a great extent the most information, with the second and third adding only small proportions (on average 18.8 and 8.4\%, respectively). 3. It was shown that the magnitude of the second and higher principal components is even smaller if the spike train analysis is started after the onset of the neuronal response, instead of before the neuronal response has started. This suggests that variations in response latency are at least a part of what is reflected by the second and higher principal components. 4. The first principal component was correlated with the mean firing rate of the neurons. The second and higher principal components reflected at least partly the onset properties of the neuronal responses, such as response latency differences between the stimuli. 5. A considerable proportion of the information available from principal components 1-3 is available in the firing rate of the neuron. 6. Periods of the firing rate of as little as 50 or even 20 ms are sufficient to give a reasonable estimate of the firing rate of the neuron. 7. Information theory analysis showed that in short epochs (e.g., 50 ms) the information available from the firing rate can be as high, on average, as 84.4\% of that available from the firing rate calculated over 400 ms, and 52.0\% of that available from principal components 1-3 in the 400-ms period. It was also found that 44.0\% of the information calculated from the first three principal components is available in the firing rates calculated over epochs as short as 20 ms. 8. More information was available near the start of the neuronal response, and the information available from short epochs became less later in the neuronal response. 9. Taken together, these analyses provide evidence that a short period of firing taken close to the start of the neuronal response provides a reasonable proportion of the total information that would be available if a long period of neuronal firing (e.g., 400 ms) were utilized to extract it, even if temporal encoding were used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

We find that the exponential model has to be rejected in 84\% of cases (at the p < 0.01 level). A new model, which accounts for the firing rate distribution found in terms of slow and fast variability in the inputs that produce neuronal activation, is rejected statistically in only 16\% of cases.

  abstract      = {Multiple factors simultaneously affect the spiking activity of individual neurons. Determining the effects and relative importance of these factors is a challenging problem in neurophysiology. We propose a statistical framework based on the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to three typical covariates: the neuron's own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and extrinsic covariates such as stimuli or behavior. The framework uses parametric models of the conditional intensity function to define a neuron's spiking probability in terms of the covariates. The discrete time likelihood function for point processes is used to carry out model fitting and model analysis. We show that, by modeling the logarithm of the conditional intensity function as a linear combination of functions of the covariates, the discrete time point process likelihood function is readily analyzed in the generalized linear model (GLM) framework. We illustrate our approach for both GLM and non-GLM likelihood functions using simulated data and multivariate single-unit activity data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of a monkey performing a visuomotor pursuit-tracking task. The point process framework provides a flexible, computationally efficient approach for maximum likelihood estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, residual analysis, model selection, and neural decoding. The framework thus allows for the formulation and analysis of point process models of neural spiking activity that readily capture the simultaneous effects of multiple covariates and enables the assessment of their relative importance.},

  abstract      = {Neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) of cats show strong stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). In probabilistic settings, in which one stimulus is common and another is rare, responses to common sounds adapt more strongly than responses to rare sounds. This SSA could be a correlate of auditory sensory memory at the level of single A1 neurons. Here we studied adaptation in A1 neurons, using three different probabilistic designs. We showed that SSA has several time scales concurrently, spanning many orders of magnitude, from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds. Similar time scales are known for the auditory memory span of humans, as measured both psychophysically and using evoked potentials. A simple model, with linear dependence on both short-term and long-term stimulus history, provided a good fit to A1 responses. Auditory thalamus neurons did not show SSA, and their responses were poorly fitted by the same model. In addition, SSA increased the proportion of failures in the responses of A1 neurons to the adapting stimulus. Finally, SSA caused a bias in the neuronal responses to unbiased stimuli, enhancing the responses to eccentric stimuli. Therefore, we propose that a major function of SSA in A1 neurons is to encode auditory sensory memory on multiple time scales. This SSA might play a role in stream segregation and in binding of auditory objects over many time scales, a property that is crucial for processing of natural auditory scenes in cats and of speech and music in humans.},

  abstract      = {The ability to detect rare auditory events can be critical for survival. We report here that neurons in cat primary auditory cortex (A1) responded more strongly to a rarely presented sound than to the same sound when it was common. For the rare stimuli, we used both frequency and amplitude deviants. Moreover, some A1 neurons showed hyperacuity for frequency deviants--a frequency resolution one order of magnitude better than receptive field widths in A1. In contrast, auditory thalamic neurons were insensitive to the probability of frequency deviants. These phenomena resulted from stimulus-specific adaptation in A1, which may be a single-neuron correlate of an extensively studied cortical potential--mismatch negativity--that is evoked by rare sounds. Our results thus indicate that A1 neurons, in addition to processing the acoustic features of sounds, may also be involved in sensory memory and novelty detection.},

Indeed, a correlation of firing between cortical neurons, seen following sensory stimuli or during motor behaviour, has been described. However, the time course of modifications of correlation in relation to behaviour was not evaluated systematically. Here we show that correlated firing between single neurons, recorded simultaneously in the frontal cortex of monkeys performing a behavioural task, evolves within a fraction of a second, and in systematic relation to behavioural events. Moreover, the dynamic patterns of correlation depend on the distance between neurons, and can emerge even without modulation of the firing rates. These findings support the notion that neurons can associate rapidly into a functional group in order to perform a computational task, at the same time becoming dissociated from concurrently activated competing groups. Thus, they call for a revision of prevailing models of neural coding that rely solely on single neuron firing rates.},

  abstract      = {Visual cues are known to aid auditory processing when they provide direct information about signal content, as in lip reading. However, some studies hint that visual cues also aid auditory perception by guiding attention to the target in a mixture of similar sounds. The current study directly tests this idea for complex, nonspeech auditory signals, using a visual cue providing only timing information about the target. Listeners were asked to identify a target zebra finch bird song played at a random time within a longer, competing masker. Two different maskers were used: noise and a chorus of competing bird songs. On half of all trials, a visual cue indicated the timing of the target within the masker. For the noise masker, the visual cue did not affect performance when target and masker were from the same location, but improved performance when target and masker were in different locations. In contrast, for the chorus masker, visual cues improved performance only when target and masker were perceived as coming from the same direction. These results suggest that simple visual cues for when to listen improve target identification by enhancing sounds near the threshold of audibility when the target is energetically masked and by enhancing segregation when it is difficult to direct selective attention to the target. Visual cues help little when target and masker already differ in attributes that enable listeners to engage selective auditory attention effectively, including differences in spectrotemporal structure and in perceived location.},

In zebra finches, neural centers that are necessary for the acquisition and production of learned vocalizations are known, and they all respond to acoustic stimulation. However, the circuits by which conspecific auditory signals are perceived, processed, and stored in long-term memory have not been well documented. In particular, no evidence exists of direct connections between auditory and vocal motor pathways, and two newly identified centers for auditory processing, caudomedial neostriatum (Ncm) and caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale (cmHV), have no documented place among known auditory circuits. Our goal was to describe anatomically the auditory pathways in adult zebra finch males and, specifically, to show the projections by which Ncm and vocal motor centers may receive auditory input. By using injections of different kinds of neuroanatomical tracers (biotinylated dextran amines, rhodamine-linked dextran amines, biocytin, fluorogold, and rhodamine-linked latex beads), we have shown that, as in other avian groups, the neostriatal field L complex in caudal telencephalon is the primary forebrain relay for pathways originating in the auditory thalamus, i.e., the nucleus ovoidalis complex (Ov). In addition, Ncm and cmHV also receive input from the Ov complex. Ov has been broken down into two parts, the Ov ``core'' and ``shell,'' which project in parallel to different targets in the caudal telencephalon. Parts of the field L complex are connected among themselves and to Ncm, cmHV, and caudolateral Hv (clHV) through a complex web of largely reciprocal pathways. In addition, clHV and parts of the field L complex project strongly to the ``shelf'' of neostriatum underneath the song control nucleus high vocal center (HVC) and to the ``cup'' of archistriatum rostrodorsal to another song-control nucleus, the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA). We have documented two points at which the vocal motor pathway may pick up auditory signals: the HVC-shelf interface and a projection from clHV to the nucleus interfacialis (NIf), which projects to HVC. These data represent the most complete survey to date of auditory pathways in the adult male zebra finch brain, and of their projections to motor stations of the song system.},

  abstract      = {Despite the lack of a layered neocortex and fundamental differences in endbrain organization in birds compared with mammals, intelligent species evolved from both vertebrate classes. Among birds, corvids show exceptional cognitive flexibility. Here we explore the neuronal foundation of corvid cognition by recording single-unit activity from an association area known as the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) while carrion crows make flexible rule-guided decisions, a hallmark of executive control functions. The most prevalent activity in NCL represents the behavioural rules, while abstracting over sample images and sensory modalities of the rule cues. Rule coding is weaker in error trials, thus predicting the crows' behavioural decisions. This suggests that the abstraction of general principles may be an important function of the NCL, mirroring the function of primate prefrontal cortex. These findings emphasize that intelligence in vertebrates does not necessarily rely on a neocortex but can be realized in endbrain circuitries that developed independently via convergent evolution.},

  abstract      = {We recorded single-unit activity of 25 units in the parafoveal representation of macaque V1 to transient appearance of sinusoidal gratings. Gratings were systematically varied in spatial phase and in one or two of the following: contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation. Individual responses were compared based on spike counts, and also according to metrics sensitive to spike timing. For each metric, the extent of stimulus-dependent clustering of individual responses was assessed via the transmitted information, H. In nearly all data sets, stimulus-dependent clustering was maximal for metrics sensitive to the temporal pattern of spikes, typically with a precision of 25-50 ms. To focus on the interaction of spatial phase with other stimulus attributes, each data set was analyzed in two ways. In the ``pooled phases'' approach, the phase of the stimulus was ignored in the assessment of clustering, to yield an index Hpooled. In the ``individual phases'' approach, clustering was calculated separately for each spatial phase and then averaged across spatial phases to yield an index Hindiv. Hpooled expresses the extent to which a spike train represents contrast, spatial frequency, or orientation in a manner which is not confounded by spatial phase (phase-independent representation), whereas Hindiv expresses the extent to which a spike train represents one of these attributes, provided spatial phase is fixed (phase-dependent representation). Here, representation means that a stimulus attribute has a reproducible and systematic influence on individual responses, not a neural mechanism for decoding this influence. During the initial 100 ms of the response, contrast was represented in a phase-dependent manner by simple cells but primarily in a phase-independent manner by complex cells. As the response evolved, simple cell responses acquired phase-independent contrast information, whereas complex cells acquired phase-dependent contrast information. Simple cells represented orientation and spatial frequency in a primarily phase-dependent manner, but also they contained some phase-independent information in their initial response segment. Complex cells showed primarily phase-independent representation of orientation but primarily phase-dependent representation of spatial frequency. Joint representation of two attributes (contrast and spatial frequency, contrast and orientation, spatial frequency and orientation) was primarily phase dependent for simple cells, and primarily phase independent for complex cells. In simple and complex cells, the variability in the number of spikes elicited on each response was substantially greater than the expectations of a Poisson process. Although some of this variation could be attributed to the dependence of the response on the spatial phase of the grating, variability was still markedly greater than Poisson when the contribution of spatial phase to response variance was removed.},

This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.},

Although this orientation-selective practice induced a marked anisotropy in his behavioural performance, this was not matched by a similar anisotropy in single-cell response properties. In a second experiment, we compared the response properties of TE cells in two monkeys before and after practice in the discrimination of small orientation differences. The training had no effect on either the responsiveness or the orientation tuning. We did, however, observe alterations in the pattern of response modulations induced by the behavioural context. However, these changes with practice, although present in both monkeys, were not consistent from animal to animal.

Each unit is represented by a vector whose magnitude and direction correspond to the response magnitude and preferred orientation of the unit, respectively. The orientation of the population vector, i.e. the vector sum of the ensemble of units, is the signalled orientation on a particular trial. The accuracy of this population vector orientation coding was determined as a function of a number of parameters by computer simulation. I have shown that even with broadly orientation tuned units possessing considerable response variance, the accuracy of the orientation of the population vector can be as good as behaviorally measured just noticeable differences in orientation. The accuracy of the population code is shown to depend upon the number of units, the average response strength, the orientation band-width, response variability and the response covariance.

  abstract      = {We have studied the mechanism of contour perception by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of alert rhesus monkeys. In order to assess the relationship between neural signals and perception, we compared the responses to edges and lines with the responses to patterns in which human observers perceive a contour where no line or edge is given (anomalous contour), such as the border between gratings of thin lines offset by half a cycle. With only one exception out of 60, orientation-selective neurons in area V1 did not signal the anomalous contour. Many neurons failed to respond to this stimulus at all, others responded according to the orientation of the grating lines. In area V2, 45 of 103 neurons (44\%) signaled the orientation of the anomalous contour. Sixteen did so without signaling the orientation of the inducing lines. Some responded better to anomalous contours than to the optimum bars or edges. Preferred orientations and widths of tuning for anomalous contour and bar or edge were found to be highly correlated, but not identical, in each neuron. Similar to perception, the neuronal responses depended on a minimum number of lines inducing the contour, but not so much on line spacing, and tended to be weaker when the lines were oblique rather than orthogonal to the border. With oblique lines, the orientations signaled were biased towards the orientation orthogonal to the lines, as in the Zollner illusion. We conclude that contours may be defined first at the level of V2. While the unresponsiveness of neurons in V1 to this type of anomalous contour is in agreement with linear filter predictions, the responses of V2 neurons need to be explained. We assume that they sum the signals of 2 parallel paths, one that defines edges and lines and another that defines anomalous contours by pooling signals from end-stopped receptive fields oriented mainly orthogonal to the contour.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: After ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, female hearts demonstrate improved functional recovery compared with male, which suggests a protective role for estrogen. Acute postischemic treatment with 17-beta-estradiol (E2) attenuates myocardial dysfunction. However, it is unknown by which estrogen receptor (ER) E2 mediates this acute cardioprotection during I/R. Therefore, we hypothesize that postischemic infusion of the selective ER-alpha agonist (4,4',4''-[4-propyl-(1H)-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl]tris-phenol [PPT]) or the selective ER-beta agonist (2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile [DPN]) will improve myocardial function after I/R injury. METHODS: Isolated, perfused hearts (Langendorff) from adult male rats were subjected to 25 minutes of ischemia followed by 40 minutes of reperfusion. Hearts (n = 4-6 per group) were randomly infused with either perfusate, PPT or DPN at 1, 10, or 100 nmol/L throughout reperfusion. After I/R, heart tissue was analyzed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). RESULTS: Postischemic treatment with 10 nmol/L of PPT significantly improved myocardial function. Additionally, 10 or 100 nmol/L of DPN significantly increased myocardial functional recovery after I/R injury, with maximum benefit at the 10 nmol/L dose. A trend toward lower levels of LDH was noted in DPN- and PPT-treated groups after I/R injury. Neither PPT nor DPN affected myocardial production of TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. However, higher levels of myocardial VEGF were noted in the PPT-treated group compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Both ER-alpha and ER-beta are involved in mediating E2-induced rapid cardioprotection after I/R injury. Advancing our understanding of both ER subtypes may be useful for the development of novel strategies that may benefit both males and females in response to myocardial ischemia.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Signal transducer and activator of transduction 3 (STAT3) pathway has been shown to be cardioprotective. We observed decreased STAT3/suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in male hearts, which was associated with worse postischemic myocardial function compared with females. However, it is unclear whether this downregulation of myocardial STAT3/SOCS3 is due to testosterone in males. We hypothesized that after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), (1) endogenous testosterone decreases myocardial STAT3 and SOCS3 in males, and (2) administration of exogenous testosterone reduces myocardial STAT3/SOCS3 in female and castrated male hearts. METHODS: To study this, hearts from I/R injury (Langendorff) were homogenized and assessed for phosphorylated-STAT3 (p-STAT3), total-STAT3 (T-STAT3), SOCS3, and GAPDH by Western blot. We grouped age-matched adult males, females, castrated males, males with androgen receptor blocker-flutamide implantation, females, and castrated males with chronic (3-week) 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) release pellet implantation or acute (5-minute) testosterone infusion (ATI) before ischemia (n = 5-9 per group). RESULTS: Castration or flutamide treatment significantly increased SOCS3 expression in male hearts after I/R. However, only castration increased myocardial STAT3 activation. Notably, DHT replacement or ATI decreased markedly myocardial STAT3/SOCS3 in castrated males and females subjected to I/R. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that endogenous and exogenous testosterone decrease myocardial STAT3 activation and SOCS3 expression after I/R. This represents the initial demonstration of testosterone-downregulated STAT3/SOCS3 signaling in myocardium.},

  abstract      = {Females have a lower incidence of heart failure and improved survival after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) compared with males. Although estrogen-suppressed cardiomyocyte apoptosis may be mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, it is unclear whether this action is mediated via estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta). Therefore, we hypothesized that ERbeta mediates estrogen-induced cardioprotection through PI3K/Akt and antiapoptotic signaling in females but not in males. Isolated male and female hearts from ERbeta knockout (ERbetaKO) and wild-type (WT) mice (n = 5 mice/group) were subjected to 20-min ischemia followed by 60-min reperfusion (Langendorff). Ablation of ERbeta significantly decreased postischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure in female, but not male, hearts. Reduced activation of PI3K and Akt was noted in female ERbetaKO hearts, which was associated with increased expression of caspase-3 and -8, as well as decreased Bcl-2 levels compared with WT. However, myocardial STAT3, SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), VEGF, and TNF receptors 1 and 2 levels did not change in ERbetaKO of either sex following I/R. Furthermore, deficiency of ERbeta increased myocardial JNK activation in females but increased ERK1/2 activity in males during acute I/R. We conclude that ERbeta mediates myocardial protection via upregulation of PI3K/Akt activation, decreased caspase-3 and -8, and increased Bcl-2 in female hearts following I/R. These findings provide evidence of ERbeta-mediated PI3K/Akt and antiapoptotic signaling in the myocardium and may lend insight into the mechanistic pathways behind the observed variation in clinical outcomes between males and females after myocardial infarction.},

  abstract      = {1. The temporal and spectral characteristics of neural representations of a behaviorally important species-specific vocalization were studied in neuronal populations of the primary auditory cortex (A1) of barbiturate-anesthetized adult common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), using both natural and synthetic vocalizations. The natural vocalizations used in electrophysiological experiments were recorded from the animals under study or from their conspecifics. These calls were frequently produced in vocal exchanges between members of our marmoset colony and are part of the well-defined and highly stereotyped vocal repertoire of this species. 2. The spectrotemporal discharge pattern of spatially distributed neuron populations in cortical field A1 was found to be correlated with the spectrotemporal acoustic pattern of a complex natural vocalization. However, the A1 discharge pattern was not a faithful replication of the acoustic parameters of a vocalization stimulus, but had been transformed into a more abstract representation than that in the auditory periphery. 3. Subpopulations of A1 neurons were found to respond selectively to natural vocalizations as compared with synthetic variations that had the same spectral but different temporal characteristics. A subpopulation responding selectively to a given monkey's call shared some but not all of its neuronal memberships with other individual-call-specific neuronal subpopulations. 4. In the time domain, responses of individual A1 units were phase-locked to the envelope of a portion of a complex vocalization, which was centered around a unit's characteristic frequency (CF). As a whole, discharges of A1 neuronal populations were phase-locked to discrete stimulus events but not to their rapidly changing spectral contents. The consequence was a reduction in temporal complexity and an increase in cross-population response synchronization. 5. In the frequency domain, major features of the stimulus spectrum were reflected in rate-CF profiles. The spectral features of a natural call were equally or more strongly represented by a subpopulation of A1 neurons that responded selectively to that call as compared with the entire responding A1 population. 6. Neuronal responses to a complex call were distributed very widely across cortical field A1. At the same time, the responses evoked by a vocalization scattered in discrete cortical patches were strongly synchronized to stimulus events and to each other. As a result, at any given time during the course of a vocalization, a coherent representation of the integrated spectrotemporal characteristics of a particular vocalization was present in a specific neuronal population. 7. These results suggest that the representation of behaviorally important and spectrotemporally complex species-specific vocalizations in A1 is 1) temporally integrated and 2) spectrally distributed in nature, and that the representation is carried by spatially dispersed and synchronized cortical cell assemblies that correspond to each individual's vocalizations in a specific and abstracted way.},

  abstract      = {The mammalian neocortex mediates complex cognitive behaviors, such as sensory perception, decision making, and language. The evolutionary history of the cortex, and the cells and circuitry underlying similar capabilities in nonmammals, are poorly understood, however. Two distinct features of the mammalian neocortex are lamination and radially arrayed columns that form functional modules, characterized by defined neuronal types and unique intrinsic connections. The seeming inability to identify these characteristic features in nonmammalian forebrains with earlier methods has often led to the assumption of uniqueness of neocortical cells and circuits in mammals. Using contemporary methods, we demonstrate the existence of comparable columnar functional modules in laminated auditory telencephalon of an avian species (Gallus gallus). A highly sensitive tracer was placed into individual layers of the telencephalon within the cortical region that is similar to mammalian auditory cortex. Distribution of anterograde and retrograde transportable markers revealed extensive interconnections across layers and between neurons within narrow radial columns perpendicular to the laminae. This columnar organization was further confirmed by visualization of radially oriented axonal collaterals of individual intracellularly filled neurons. Common cell types in birds and mammals that provide the cellular substrate of columnar functional modules were identified. These findings indicate that laminar and columnar properties of the neocortex are not unique to mammals and may have evolved from cells and circuits found in more ancient vertebrates. Specific functional pathways in the brain can be analyzed in regard to their common phylogenetic origins, which introduces a previously underutilized level of analysis to components involved in higher cognitive functions.},

  abstract      = {The auditory midbrain is a site of convergence of multiple auditory channels from the brainstem. In birds, two separate ascending channels have been identified, through which time and intensity information is sent to the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis, pars dorsalis (MLd), the homologue of the central nucleus of the mammalian inferior colliculus. Using in vivo anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques, the current study provides two lines of anatomical evidence supporting the presence of a third ascending channel to the chick MLd. First, three non-overlapping zones of the MLd receive inputs from three distinct cell groups in the caudodorsal brainstem. The projections from the nucleus angularis (NA) and nucleus laminaris (NL) are predominantly contralateral and may correspond to the time and intensity channels. A rostromedial portion of the MLd receives bilateral projections mainly from the regio intermedius, an interposed region of cells lying at a caudal level between the NL and NA, as well as scattered neurons embedded in the 8th nerve tract, and probably a very ventral region of the NA. Second, the bilateral zones of the MLd on two sides of the brain are reciprocally connected and do not interact with other zones of the MLd via commissural connections. In contrast, the NL-recipient zone projects contralaterally upon the NA-recipient zone. The structural separation of the third pathway from the NA and NL projections suggests a third information-processing channel, in parallel with the time and intensity channels. Neurons in the third channel appear to process very low frequency information including infrasound, probably utilizing different mechanisms than that underlying higher frequency processing.},

Across all subjects, improvements in performance were associated with an increase in the spatial extent of activation in left superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann's area 22, putative Wernicke's area), the emergence of activity in adjacent Brodmann's area 42, and the emergence of activity in right inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann's area 44), a homologue of putative Broca's area. These findings demonstrate a form of enrichment plasticity in which the early cortical effects of learning a tone-based second language involve both expansion of preexisting language-related areas and recruitment of additional cortical regions specialized for functions similar to the new language functions.},

  abstract      = {Decoding visual information from a population of retinal ganglion cells. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2336-2350, 1997. This work investigates how a time-dependent visual stimulus is encoded by the collective activity of many retinal ganglion cells. Multiple ganglion cell spike trains were recorded simultaneously from the isolated retina of the tiger salamander using a multielectrode array. The stimulus consisted of photopic, spatially uniform, temporally broadband flicker. From the recorded spike trains, an estimate was obtained of the stimulus intensity as a function of time. This was compared with the actual stimulus to assess the quality and quantity of visual information conveyed by the ganglion cell population. Two algorithms were used to decode the spike trains: an optimized linear filter in which each action potential made an additive contribution to the stimulus estimate and an artificial neural network trained by back-propagation to match spike trains with stimuli. The two methods performed indistinguishably, suggesting that most of the information about this stimulus can be extracted by linear operations on the spike trains. Individual ganglion cells conveyed information at a rate of 3.2 +/- 1.7 bits/s (mean +/- SD), with an average information content per spike of 1.6 bits. The maximal possible rate of information transmission compatible with the measured spiking statistics was 13.9 +/- 6.3 bits/s. On average, ganglion cells used 22\% of this capacity to encode visual information. When a decoder received two spike trains of the same response type, the reconstruction improved only marginally over that obtained from a single cell. However, a decoder using an and an cell extracted as much information as the sum of that obtained from each cell alone. Thus cells of opposite response type encode different and nonoverlapping features of the stimulus. As more spike trains were provided to the decoder, the total information rate rapidly saturated, with 79\% of the maximal value obtained from a local cluster of just four neurons of different functional types. The decoding filter applied to a given neuron's spikes within such a multiunit decoder differed substantially from the filter applied to that same neuron in a single-unit decoder. This shows that the optimal interpretation of a ganglion cell's action potential depends strongly on the simultaneous activity of other nearby cells. The quality of the stimulus reconstruction varied greatly with frequency: flicker components below 1 Hz and above 10 Hz were reconstructed poorly, and the performance was optimal near 2.5 Hz. Further analysis suggests that temporal encoding by ganglion cell spike trains is limited by slow phototransduction in the cone photoreceptors and a corrupting noise source proximal to the cones.},

In this functional magnetic resonance experiment, we investigated the human brain areas engaged in the analysis of pitch sequences and sequences of acoustic spatial locations in a paradigm in which both could be varied independently. Subjects were presented with sequences of sounds in which the individual sounds were regular interval noises with variable pitch. Positions of individual sounds were varied using a virtual acoustic space paradigm during scanning. Sound sequences with changing pitch specifically activated lateral Heschl's gyrus (HG), anterior planum temporale (PT), planum polare, and superior temporal gyrus anterior to HG. Sound sequences with changing spatial locations specifically activated posteromedial PT. These results demonstrate directly that distinct mechanisms for the analysis of pitch sequences and acoustic spatial sequences exist in the human brain. This functional differentiation is evident as early as PT: within PT, pitch pattern is processed anterolaterally and spatial location is processed posteromedially. These areas may represent human homologs of macaque lateral and medial belt, respectively.},

  abstract      = {The zebra finch is an important model organism in several fields with unique relevance to human neuroscience. Like other songbirds, the zebra finch communicates through learned vocalizations, an ability otherwise documented only in humans and a few other animals and lacking in the chicken-the only bird with a sequenced genome until now. Here we present a structural, functional and comparative analysis of the genome sequence of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), which is a songbird belonging to the large avian order Passeriformes. We find that the overall structures of the genomes are similar in zebra finch and chicken, but they differ in many intrachromosomal rearrangements, lineage-specific gene family expansions, the number of long-terminal-repeat-based retrotransposons, and mechanisms of sex chromosome dosage compensation. We show that song behaviour engages gene regulatory networks in the zebra finch brain, altering the expression of long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, transcription factors and their targets. We also show evidence for rapid molecular evolution in the songbird lineage of genes that are regulated during song experience. These results indicate an active involvement of the genome in neural processes underlying vocal communication and identify potential genetic substrates for the evolution and regulation of this behaviour.},

  abstract      = {Ultrasonic attenuation and sound speed have been investigated in trabecular bone by numerous authors. Ultrasonic backscatter has received much less attention. To investigate relationships among these three ultrasonic parameters and bone mineral density (BMD), 30 defatted human calcanei were investigated in vitro. Normalized broadband ultrasonic attenuation (nBUA), sound speed (SOS), and logarithm of ultrasonic backscatter coefficient (LBC) were measured. Bone mineral density was assessed using single-beam dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The correlation coefficients of least squares linear regressions of the three individual ultrasound (US) parameters with BMD were 0.84 (nBUA), 0.84 (SOS) and 0.79 (LBC). The 95\% confidence intervals for the correlation coefficients were 0. 69-0.92 (nBUA), 0.68-0.92 (SOS) and 0.60-0.90 (LBC). The correlations among pairs of US variables ranged from 0.63-0.79. Variations in nBUA accounted for r(2) = 62\% of the variations in LBC. Variations in SOS accounted for r(2) = 40\% of the variations in LBC. These results suggest that ultrasonic backscattering properties may contain substantial information not already contained in nBUA and SOS. A multiple regression model including all three US variables was somewhat more predictive of BMD than a model including only nBUA and SOS.},

Furthermore, no tracer has proven potent enough to label any connected neurons whatsoever when starting from a single cell. Here we present a transsynaptic tracer that crosses only one synaptic step, unambiguously identifying cells directly presynaptic to the starting population. Based on rabies virus, it is genetically targetable, allows high-level expression of any gene of interest in the synaptically coupled neurons, and robustly labels connections made to single cells. This technology should enable a far more detailed understanding of neural connectivity than has previously been possible.},

  abstract      = {It is often suggested that efficient neural codes for natural visual information should be 'sparse'. However, the term 'sparse' has been used in two different ways--firstly to describe codes in which few neurons are active at any time ('population sparseness'), and secondly to describe codes in which each neuron's lifetime response distribution has high kurtosis ('lifetime sparseness'). Although these ideas are related, they are not identical, and the most common measure of lifetime sparseness--the kurtosis of the lifetime response distributions of the neurons--provides no information about population sparseness. We have measured the population sparseness and lifetime kurtosis of several biologically inspired coding schemes. We used three measures of population sparseness (population kurtosis, Treves-Rolls sparseness and 'activity sparseness'), and found them to be in close agreement with one another. However, we also measured the lifetime kurtosis of the cells in each code. We found that lifetime kurtosis is uncorrelated with population sparseness for the codes we used. Lifetime kurtosis is not, therefore, a useful measure of the population sparseness of a code. Moreover, the Gabor-like codes, which are often assumed to have high population sparseness (since they have high lifetime kurtosis), actually turned out to have rather low population sparseness. Surprisingly, principal components filters produced the codes with the highest population sparseness.},

We offer an account of auditory perception suggesting that representations of predictable patterns, or 'regularities', extracted from the incoming sounds serve as auditory perceptual objects. The auditory system continuously searches for regularities within the acoustic signal. Primitive regularities may be encoded by neurons adapting their response to specific sounds. Such neurons have been observed in many parts of the auditory system. Representations of the detected regularities produce predictions of upcoming sounds as well as alternative solutions for parsing the composite input into coherent sequences potentially emitted by putative sound sources. Accuracy of the predictions can be utilized for selecting the most likely interpretation of the auditory input. Thus in our view, perception generates hypotheses about the causal structure of the world.},

  abstract      = {Neuromagnetic fields were recorded from human subjects as they listened selectively to sequences of rapidly presented tones in one ear while ignoring tones of a different pitch in the opposite ear. Tones in the attended ear evoked larger magnetic brain responses than did unattended tones in the latency ranges 20-50 msec and 80-130 msec poststimulus. Source localization techniques in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging placed the neural generators of these early attention-sensitive brain responses in auditory cortex on the supratemporal plane. These data demonstrate that focused auditory attention in humans can selectively modulate sensory processing in auditory cortex beginning as early as 20 msec poststimulus, thereby providing strong evidence for an ``early selection'' mechanism of auditory attention that can regulate auditory input at or before the initial stages of cortical analysis.},

The multi-unit Shannon information rates were compared with those of the constituent single-unit spike trains and also with those of corresponding labelled line signals.The mutual information in the multi-unit response was found to depend on the degree of similarity in the attribute-specific information of the single-unit spike trains. As long as the units were encoding similar attribute-specific information, the multi-unit signal had greater information than any of the individual units. If the units' responses were confounded by different amounts, the multi-unit response could Hot recover the maximal single-unit information. Labelled line and pooled responses had similar mutual information when the information in the constituent units was similar. However, the normalized gain in information of a labelled line response over a pooled response increased from 27\% to 84\%, relative to the maximum single-unit information rate, as the difference in constituent single-unit information increased to 100\%.Information in single-unit responses is not completely lost when multiple units are superimposed. There are cases in which the union of single-Unit spike trains can fully conserve single-unit information and even reduce the effect of confounding information present in the individual responses. More information is available in pairs of responses when the identities of the units are maintained. Summed responses can be used at low informational cost in redundantly encoding clusters of neurons. Higher information losses are incurred as the encoding becomes more independent.},

  abstract      = {While auditory cortex in non-human primates has been subdivided into multiple functionally specialized auditory cortical fields (ACFs), the boundaries and functional specialization of human ACFs have not been defined. In the current study, we evaluated whether a widely accepted primate model of auditory cortex could explain regional tuning properties of fMRI activations on the cortical surface to attended and non-attended tones of different frequency, location, and intensity. The limits of auditory cortex were defined by voxels that showed significant activations to non-attended sounds. Three centrally located fields with mirror-symmetric tonotopic organization were identified and assigned to the three core fields of the primate model while surrounding activations were assigned to belt fields following procedures similar to those used in macaque fMRI studies. The functional properties of core, medial belt, and lateral belt field groups were then analyzed. Field groups were distinguished by tonotopic organization, frequency selectivity, intensity sensitivity, contralaterality, binaural enhancement, attentional modulation, and hemispheric asymmetry. In general, core fields showed greater sensitivity to sound properties than did belt fields, while belt fields showed greater attentional modulation than core fields. Significant distinctions in intensity sensitivity and contralaterality were seen between adjacent core fields A1 and R, while multiple differences in tuning properties were evident at boundaries between adjacent core and belt fields. The reliable differences in functional properties between fields and field groups suggest that the basic primate pattern of auditory cortex organization is preserved in humans. A comparison of the sizes of functionally defined ACFs in humans and macaques reveals a significant relative expansion in human lateral belt fields implicated in the processing of speech.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: While human auditory cortex is known to contain tonotopically organized auditory cortical fields (ACFs), little is known about how processing in these fields is modulated by other acoustic features or by attention. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and population-based cortical surface analysis to characterize the tonotopic organization of human auditory cortex and analyze the influence of tone intensity, ear of delivery, scanner background noise, and intermodal selective attention on auditory cortex activations. Medial auditory cortex surrounding Heschl's gyrus showed large sensory (unattended) activations with two mirror-symmetric tonotopic fields similar to those observed in non-human primates. Sensory responses in medial regions had symmetrical distributions with respect to the left and right hemispheres, were enlarged for tones of increased intensity, and were enhanced when sparse image acquisition reduced scanner acoustic noise. Spatial distribution analysis suggested that changes in tone intensity shifted activation within isofrequency bands. Activations to monaural tones were enhanced over the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation, where they produced activations similar to those produced by binaural sounds. Lateral regions of auditory cortex showed small sensory responses that were larger in the right than left hemisphere, lacked tonotopic organization, and were uninfluenced by acoustic parameters. Sensory responses in both medial and lateral auditory cortex decreased in magnitude throughout stimulus blocks. Attention-related modulations (ARMs) were larger in lateral than medial regions of auditory cortex and appeared to arise primarily in belt and parabelt auditory fields. ARMs lacked tonotopic organization, were unaffected by acoustic parameters, and had distributions that were distinct from those of sensory responses. Unlike the gradual adaptation seen for sensory responses, ARMs increased in amplitude throughout stimulus blocks. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results are consistent with the view that medial regions of human auditory cortex contain tonotopically organized core and belt fields that map the basic acoustic features of sounds while surrounding higher-order parabelt regions are tuned to more abstract stimulus attributes. Intermodal selective attention enhances processing in neuronal populations that are partially distinct from those activated by unattended stimuli.},

To identify neural mechanisms for the discrimination of such natural sounds, we compared the linear spectro-temporal tuning properties of auditory midbrain and forebrain neurons in zebra finches with the statistics of natural sounds, including song. Here, we demonstrate that ensembles of auditory neurons are tuned to auditory features that enhance the acoustic differences between classes of natural sounds, and among the songs of individual birds. Tuning specifically avoids the spectro-temporal modulations that are redundant across natural sounds and therefore provide little information; rather, it overlaps with the temporal modulations that differ most across sounds. By comparing the real tuning and a less selective model of spectro-temporal tuning, we found that the real modulation tuning increases the neural discrimination of different sounds. Additionally, auditory neurons discriminate among zebra finch song segments better than among synthetic sound segments.},

We recorded the electrophysiological responses of single auditory neurons in the songbird midbrain and forebrain to conspecific song, measured their tuning by calculating spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs), and classified them using multiple cluster analysis methods. Based on STRF shape, cells clustered into functional groups that divided the space of acoustical features into regions that represent cues for the fundamental acoustic percepts of pitch, timbre, and rhythm. Four major groups were found in the midbrain, and five major groups were found in the forebrain. Comparing STRFs in midbrain and forebrain neurons suggested that both inheritance and emergence of tuning properties occur as information ascends the auditory processing stream.},

  abstract      = {In a first study, the representations of skin surfaces of the hand in the primary somatosensory cortex, area 3b, were reconstructed in owl monkeys and squirrel monkeys trained to pick up food pellets from small, shallow wells, a task which required skilled use of the digits. Training sessions included limited manual exercise over a total period of a few hours of practice. From an early clumsy performance in which many retrieval attempts were required for each successful pellet retrieval, the monkeys exhibited a gradual improvement. Typically, the animals used various combinations of digits before developing a successful retrieval strategy. As the behavior came to be stereotyped, monkeys consistently engaged surfaces of the distal phalanges of one or two digits in the palpation and capture of food pellets from the smallest wells. Microelectrode mapping of the hand surfaces revealed that the glabrous skin of the fingertips predominantly involved in the dexterity task was represented over topographically expanded cortical sectors. Furthermore, cutaneous receptive fields which covered the most frequently stimulated digital tip surfaces were less than half as large as were those representing the corresponding surfaces of control digits. In a second series of experiments, Long-Evans rats were assigned to environments promoting differential tactile experience (standard, enriched, and impoverished) for 80 to 115 days from the time of weaning. A fourth group of young adult rat experienced a severe restriction of forepaw exploratory movement for either 7 or 15 days. Cortical maps derived in the primary somatosensory cortex showed that environmental enrichment induced a substantial enlargement of the cutaneous forepaw representation, and improved its spatial resolution (smaller glabrous receptive fields). In contrast, tactile impoverishment resulted in a degradation of the forepaw representation that was characterized by larger cutaneous receptive fields and the emergence of non-cutaneous responses. Cortical maps derived in the hemispheres contralateral to the immobilized forelimb exhibited a severe decrease of about 50\% in the overall areal extent of the cutaneous representation of the forepaw, which resulted from the invasion of topographically organized cortical zones of non-cutaneous responses, and numerous discontinuities in the representation of contiguous skin territories. The size and the spatial arrangement of the cutaneous receptive fields were not significantly modified by the immobilization of the contralateral forelimb. Similar results were obtained regardless of whether the forelimb restriction lasted 7 or 15 days. These two studies corroborate the view that representational constructs are permanently reshaped by novel experiences through dynamic competitive processes. These studies also support the notion that subject-environment interactions play a crucial role in the maintenance of basic organizational features of somatosensory representations.},

  abstract      = {The central auditory system of the mustached bat shows two types of reorganization of cochleotopic (frequency) maps: expanded reorganization resulting from shifts in the best frequencies (BFs) of neurons toward the BF of repetitively stimulated cortical neurons (hereafter centripetal BF shifts) and compressed reorganization resulting from the BF shifts of neurons away from the BF of the stimulated cortical neurons (hereafter centrifugal BF shifts). Facilitation and inhibition evoked by the corticofugal system have been hypothesized to be respectively related to centripetal and centrifugal BF shifts. If this hypothesis is correct, bicuculline (an antagonist of inhibitory GABA-A receptors) applied to cortical neurons would change centrifugal BF shifts into centripetal BF shifts. In the mustached bat, electric stimulation of cortical Doppler-shifted constant-frequency neurons, which are highly specialized for frequency analysis, evokes the centrifugal BF shifts of ipsilateral collicular and cortical Doppler-shifted constant-frequency neurons and contralateral cochlear hair cells. Bicuculline applied to the stimulation site changed the centrifugal BF shifts into centripetal BF shifts. On the other hand, electric stimulation of neurons in the posterior division of the auditory cortex, which are not particularly specialized for frequency analysis, evokes centripetal BF shifts of cortical neurons located near the stimulated cortical neurons. Bicuculline applied to the stimulation site augmented centripetal BF shifts but did not change the direction of the shifts. These observations support the hypothesis and indicate that centripetal and centrifugal BF shifts are both based on a single mechanism consisting of two components: facilitation and inhibition.},

Vv is subpallial whereas Dp is the homolog of olfactory cortex. Both areas lack an obvious topographic organization but perform complementary computations. Responses to different odors and their mixtures indicate that Vv neurons pool convergent inputs, resulting in broadened tuning curves and overlapping odor representations. Neuronal circuits in Dp, in contrast, produce a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to each neuron that controls action potential firing in an odor-dependent manner. This mechanism can extract information about combinations of molecular features from ensembles of active and inactive mitral cells, suggesting that pattern processing in Dp establishes representations of odor objects.},

Although psychophysical studies suggest that perceptual learning induces similar changes in primary visual cortex (V1), studies that have measured the response properties of individual neurons have failed to find effects of the size described for the other sensory systems. We have examined the effect of learning on neuronal response properties in a visual area that lies at a later stage of cortical processing, area V4. Adult macaque monkeys were trained extensively on orientation discrimination at a specific retinal location using a narrow range of orientations. During the course of training, the subjects achieved substantial improvement in orientation discrimination that was primarily restricted to the trained location. After training, neurons in V4 with receptive fields overlapping the trained location had stronger responses and narrower orientation tuning curves than neurons with receptive fields in the opposite, untrained hemifield. The changes were most prominent for neurons that preferred orientations close to the trained range of orientations. These results provide the first demonstration of perceptual learning modifying basic neuronal response properties at an intermediate level of visual cortex and give insights into the distribution of plasticity across adult visual cortex.},

This enhanced selectivity has been taken as evidence for learning-related plasticity. Much less is known, in contrast, about the representation of well-learned information in the hippocampus. In this study, we examined the responses of individual hippocampal neurons to well-learned and novel stimuli presented in the context of an associative learning task. There was no difference in the response magnitude or visual response latency of hippocampal neurons to the well-learned and novel stimuli. In contrast, hippocampal neurons responded significantly more selectively to the well-learned stimuli relative to the novel stimuli. These findings show that hippocampal cells, like neocortical cells, show greater selectivity to well-learned stimuli compared to novel stimuli.},

  abstract      = {The existence of relative pitch perception in animals is difficult to demonstrate, since unlike humans, animals often attend to absolute rather than relative properties of sound elements. However, the results of the present study show that ferrets can be trained using relative pitch to discriminate two-tone sequences (rising vs. falling). Three ferrets were trained using a positive-reinforcement paradigm in which sequences of reference (one to five repeats) and target stimuli were presented, and animals were rewarded only when responding correctly to the target. The training procedure consisted of three training phases that successively shaped the ferrets to attend to relative pitch. In Phase-1 training, animals learned the basic task with sequences of invariant tone-pairs and could use absolute pitch information. During Phase-2 training, in order to emphasize relative cues, absolute pitch was varied each trial within a two-octave frequency range. In Phase-3 training, absolute pitch cues were removed, and only relative cue information was available to solve the task. Two ferrets successfully completed training on all three phases and achieved significant discriminative performance over the trained four-octave frequency range. These results suggest that ferrets can be trained to discern the relative pitch relationship of a sequence of tone-pairs independent of frequency.},

A proportion of cells in the temporal cortex of monkeys responds specifically to objects, such as faces, but the type of coding used by these cells is not known. Population analysis of two sets of such cells showed that information is carried at the level of the population and that this information relates, in the anterior inferotemporal cortex, to the physical properties of face stimuli and, in the superior temporal polysensory area, to other aspects of the faces, such as their familiarity. There was often sufficient information in small populations of neurons to identify particular faces. These results suggest that representations of complex stimuli in the higher visual areas may take the form of a sparse population code.},

Neurons in the forebrain nucleus robustus archistriatalis, which receives input from the HVc, exhibited precisely timed and structured bursts of activity that were uniquely associated with note identity. Hence, units of vocal behavior are represented hierarchically in the avian forebrain. The representation of temporal sequences at each level of the hierarchy may be established by means of a decoding process involving interactions of higher level input with intrinsic local circuitry. Behavior is apparently represented by precise temporal patterning of spike trains at lower levels of the hierarchy.},

The most commonly reported EEG iGBR is a broadband transient increase in power at the gamma range approximately 200-300 ms following stimulus onset. A conspicuous feature of this iGBR is the trial-to-trial poststimulus latency variability, which has been insufficiently addressed. Here, we show, using single-trial analysis of concomitant EEG and eye tracking, that this iGBR is tightly time locked to the onset of involuntary miniature eye movements and reflects a saccadic ``spike potential.'' The time course of the iGBR is related to an increase in the rate of saccades following a period of poststimulus saccadic inhibition. Thus, whereas neuronal gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other methods, the broadband transient iGBR recorded by scalp EEG reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics rather than neuronal oscillations.},

In the context of a clustered sparse-temporal fMRI data collection eight right-handed native German speakers performed: (i) an auditory gap detection task; and (ii) a CV syllable discrimination task. A tone perception task served as a nontemporal control condition. Here we aimed to research to what extent the left hemisphere preferentially processes linguistically relevant temporal information available in speech and nonspeech stimuli. Furthermore, we sought to find out as to whether a left hemisphere's preference for linguistically relevant temporal information is specifically constrained to verbal utterances or if nonlinguistic temporal information may also activate these areas. We collected haemodynamic responses from three time points of acquisition (TPA) with varying temporal distance from stimulus onset to gain an insight on the time course of auditory processing. Results show exclusively left-sided activations of primary and secondary auditory cortex associated with the perception of rapid temporal information. Furthermore, the data shows an overlap of activations evoked by nonspeech sounds and speech stimuli within primary and secondary auditory cortex of the left hemisphere. The present data clearly support the assumption of a shared neural network for rapid temporal information processing within the auditory domain for both speech and nonspeech signals situated in left superior temporal areas.},

Such plasticity creates great potential for flexible processing of sensory information, but the actual effects of neuronal plasticity on perceptual performance are poorly understood. The link between neuronal plasticity and performance was explored here by recording the responses of directionally selective neurons in the visual cortex while rhesus monkeys practiced a familiar task involving discrimination of motion direction. Each animal experienced a short-term improvement in perceptual sensitivity during daily experiments; sensitivity increased by an average of 19 percent over a few hundred trials. The increase in perceptual sensitivity was accompanied by a short-term improvement in neuronal sensitivity that mirrored the perceptual effect both in magnitude and in time course, which suggests that improved psychophysical performance can result directly from increased neuronal sensitivity within a sensory pathway.},

This similarity poses an intriguing puzzle: why is psychophysical sensitivity not greater than that of single neurons? Pooling responses across neurons should average out noise in the activity of single cells, leading to substantially improved psychophysical performance. If, however, noise is correlated among these neurons, the beneficial effects of pooling would be diminished. To assess correlation within a pool, the responses of pairs of neurons were recorded simultaneously during repeated stimulus presentations. We report here that the observed covariation in spike count was relatively weak, the correlation coefficient averaging 0.12. A theoretical analysis revealed, however, that weak correlation can limit substantially the signalling capacity of the pool. In addition, theory suggests a relationship between neuronal responses and psychophysical decisions which may prove useful for identifying cell populations underlying specific perceptual capacities.},
