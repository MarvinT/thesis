\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is categorical perception?}

\acf{CP} is a phenomenon that occurs when categories held by the observer, either learned or inherent, influence the observerâ€™s perception. This means that the perception of changes in the stimuli does not depend solely on the physical changes in the stimuli. Small changes in stimuli that lie near or across category boundaries are very noticeable while more substantial changes in other regions may not be noticeable at all. This means that our perceptual systems transform relatively linear sensory signals into relatively nonlinear internal representations.

The category boundary occurs at the vertical red dotted line and there is some amount of uncertainty near this boundary. The boundary is defined as the point of perceived equality or the stimuli location on the physical continuum where a participant is equally likely to classify the stimuli as A or B. \emph{Top Blue}: is the discrimination curve describing how well a participant can discriminate between nearby stimuli. \CP has been described as a peak in the discrimination curve near the category boundary. The lower axis indicates how the perceptual space is stretched compared to the physical continuum causing stimuli that are within category limits to be perceived as closer than stimuli that lie across category boundaries but are an equal distance apart.\index{cp}}

\subsection{Why European Starlings?}

European starlings ({\it Sturnus vulgaris}) are an excellent, established model organism to study auditory processing and categorical perception. Like human speech, starling song is composed of learned, spectrally complex, temporally-patterned acoustic objects (called \textit{\textbf{motifs}}), that are produced in long, well-organized temporal sequences \cite{gentner2003neuronal}, and that function in a wide range of natural behaviors. As with other complex natural signals, our understanding of how birdsongs are represented in higher cortical regions, both benefits from and is hindered by the complex spectro-temporal character of these sounds. Multiple physiological studies have used conspecific vocalizations, and reveal a strong selectivity for songs that emerges across the auditory forebrain and strengthens from field L to \ac{NCM} and \ac{CM} \cite{gentner2003neuronal, gentner2004neural, thompson2010song, jeanne2011emergence}.

European starlings (\textit{Sturnus vulgaris}) are an excellent established model organism to study auditory processing. Like human speech, a starling's song is composed of learned, complex temporally-patterned acoustic objects, called motifs, produced as part of a longer, well-organized temporal sequence \cite{gentner2003neuronal}. Starlings rely on object-level representations of motifs \cite{Meliza2010,gentner1998perceptual,Comins2013,comins2014auditory}, and the neural correlates of motif perception are localized in the regions of the auditory forebrain \emph{that are evolutionarily homologous to the mammalian auditory cortex \cite{wang2010laminar}}. 

The songbird auditory system follows the vertebrate plan \cite{Carr1992}. Field L2a is the primary telencephalic target of the auditory thalamus \cite{Karten1968}, and is the input layer for a columnar circuit spanning L1, L3, and \ac{CM}, anatomically \cite{Wang2010a,Jarvis2005}, genetically \cite{Dugas-Ford2012}, and functionally \cite{Calabrese2015} analogous to the mammalian auditory cortical micro-circuit. Field L sub-regions also project to the \ac{NCM}, a region that, a region that, along with the \ac{CLM}, shares reciprocal connections with the \ac{CMM}. Neurons in \ac{NCM} have been shown to have complex composite receptive fields \cite{kozlov2016central} that are reminiscent of the multidimensional receptive fields found in cat A1 \cite{atencio2008cooperative}. Multidimensional receptive field characteristics can be reproduced by a \ac{DNN} \cite{kozlov2016central} trained to represent starling songs. Neurons throughout the avian cortex are selective for species-specific (conspecific) vocalizations \cite{Bonke1979,Leppelsack1976,Muller1985}, with selectivity increasing from Field L2, to L1 and L3 \cite{Theunissen2004,Theunissen1998,Theunissen2000}, and again in \ac{NCM} and \ac{CM} \cite{Calabrese2015,Muller1985,Grace2003,Bonke1979,Leppelsack1976,gentner2003neuronal,Gentner2004,Thompson2010,Jeanne2011}. This is consistent with a functional hierarchy tuned to conspecific song \cite{Hsu2004,Woolley2005}, refined by experience \cite{gentner2003neuronal,Sockman2002,Sockman2005,Phan2006,Thompson2010,Jeanne2011}, with selectivity for acoustic features at multiple timescales increasing in a feed-forward manner \cite{Rose1988,Kaas2000,Binder2000,VanEssen1992}. Because of its compact organization, close relation to well-studied sensorimotor/vocal production structures, and the rich behavioral history of birdsong, the system is ideal for understanding the processing of natural acoustic communication signals.
Starlings respond to complex natural stimuli patterns such as the presence or absence of a center-embedded recursive structure \cite{gentner2006recursive,comins2014auditory,comins2014temporal}, a characteristic previously thought unique to human language (at least by Chomsky), allowing access to signals that would be invasive in humans, and cost prohibitive in non-human primates.

\subsection{The difficulties of using European Starlings}

However, the lack of parametric control over the complex acoustic features composing birdsongs (and other communication signals in other species) had rendered it difficult to more rigorously and extensively characterize both the information that these regions encode, and how this information is encoded. \comment{Do I need to put different straw-man theories here?} Ideally, we would like to parametrically control the complex natural stimuli to which high-order sensory regions are tuned, with the same precision and control that past studies have manipulated more simple stimuli like white noise and pure sine wave stimuli that can drive more primary sensory regions.

Furthermore, starlings are not among the most popular model organisms, so many of the off the shelf tools available for other model organisms haven't been established for the Starlings. This includes the genetic and viral tools as well as off the shelf hardware and tools.

Lastly, increased mobility (3-dimensional freedom and frequent backflips) makes recordings while behaving more difficult, even though there have been examples of it \cite{knudsen2013active}

\subsection{What is required for \CP research?}

The fundamental difficulty with \CP research is that it generally occurs in the perception of a high dimensional space where naturally occurring ecologically relevant stimuli exist only on non-uniformly distributed sub-manifold of that space. In terms of auditory \CP in human speech, the high dimensional space is the space of all possible sounds that could possibly be heard, most of which would sound like random noise. The naturally occurring ecologically relevant stimuli are all the possible spoken sounds or phonemes that are useful for human speech production and comprehension, which exist in a much smaller lower-dimensional subset of all possible sounds. Even within this subset of sounds, not all possible phonemes are heard with equal probability, and this distributional information may begin to shape our perceptual systems even before birth.

Because of this, the majority of auditory \CP has focused on human speech sounds, predominantly English, leveraging our intuitions and years of linguistic modeling to identify the relevant dimensions where \CP occur. \CP work concerning animal vocalizations must first identify stimuli that are categorically perceived, a process that was very labor intensive \cite{swamp sparrow series of papers} before the development of more modern techniques \cite{Tim's paper on distribution}. The variation within the songs of European starlings also makes this task easier because clustering song elements is more straightforward with more distinct clusters.

Furthermore, the identification of category boundaries is more difficult in non-human research than with human subjects. Since we can't provide instructions, we are forced to use multiple shaping or pre-training stages of operant behavioral conditioning. Also, if we permit a fully adaptive double staircase procedure, our subjects learn to exploit this and force the boundary all the way to one side or another. To solve this, we use a new staircase technique.

Last, but certainly not least, \CP requires the generation of a synthetic continuum between the categories or category exemplars. In human speech, the existence of speech synthesizers has made this task easy, at least in English. In Chinese for example, the technical difficulty in creating a Chinese-based synthetic continuum suitable for a \CP study has been proposed as a reason for the large number of papers focused on \CP in lexical tones in the Chinese language \cite{zhang2013categorical}. \CP research on animal vocalization has been limited to exploiting natural variation in recorded calls \cite{swamp sparrow cp} which invariably limits the sampling and control over the stimuli. It has also been shown that the quality of the speech synthesizer is correlated with how much \CP is observed\cite{van1999categorical}.

Thus the approach we present streamlines the following steps for \CP research in non-human vocalizations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identification of relevant dimensions where \CP occurs
    \item Identification of categorical boundaries
    \item Generation of a synthetic continuum between the categories/ category exemplars.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{History of Categorical Perception}

There is a long history of categorical perception research.

The invention of the formant speech synthesizer known as the Pattern Playback at Haskins Laboratories \cite{patternplayback} made the discovery of \CP possible.
The Pattern Playback was a machine that converted pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech in the form of a spectrogram into sound using light.

\CP was initially described as the absolute definition of completely quantal perception where subjects would be unable to discriminate differences to stimuli within a category, only noticing differences in stimuli that lies across category boundaries \cite{liberman1957discrimination, Studdert1970motor}. Although only ever described as an idealized case, this definition is far too restrictive and has been disproven many times; however, it has caused much criticism of the work done in the \CP field with critics calling for ``The end of categorical perception as we know it'' \cite{schouten2003end} etc.

Later work has instead demonstrated that with-category differences are discriminable \cite{pisoni1974reaction,carney1977noncategorical,massaro1983categorical} and meaningful \cite{miller1997internal,mcmurray2002gradient,mcmurray2008gradient}. Thus it seems there is just an increase in sensitivity to differences in stimuli that lie across category boundaries.

\CP first explored in 1957 concerning the discrimination of speech sounds within and across phenome boundaries \cite{liberman1957discrimination}.  In addition to dubbing the term ``Categorical Perception,'' Liberman suggested that \CP was unique to human speech, and furthermore, was what made human speech special. He also originally proposed the motor theory of speech perception \cite{liberman1967perception}.

Formerly thought to be peculiar to speech and color perception, \CP turns out to be far more general and may be a result of the way our neural circuits are wired to identify hierarchical patterns.

\CP also provides an intermediate explanation of equivalence classes which in turn form the basis of high-level symbolic thought and auditory \CP also forms the basis for human language.

Auditory \CP was previously thought to be strictly human trait possibly depending on special processing or that there might be some motor theory basis that could inform perception based on a motor production model. It is now thought to be a ubiquitous feature of all perceptual systems.

It has been shown in chinchilla \cite{kuhl1975speech} and later in macaques \cite{kuhl1983enhanced}, that animal models also have enhanced discriminability at human phonetic boundaries without a phylogenetic history of phenomic knowledge, either acoustic or articulatory.
These studies consist of playing human speech sounds to animals and behaviorally measuring if they place the same boundaries we do.
This has been used to argue that human languages may have adapted to use phenome category boundaries located in regions with intrinsically higher discriminability \cite{stevens1981constraints,goldstone2010categorical}

There also exists a host of research on \CP in non-human vocal communication sounds. These studies either use
natural variation in the vocalizations
artificially generated hand drawn spectrogram morphs.
These studies are only possible after considerable background work establishes the relevant categories, similar to the techniques originally used in humans to identify \CP.

Categorical boundary location preference has also been explored, mostly in the context of human speech. Early explanations included the motor theory of speech perception, which suggested that the explanation for \CP lay in the anatomy of speech production, specifically, physical differences during articulation \cite{liberman1967perception}. There have also been arguments made that a biological predisposition influenced the development of human languages pushing phenome boundaries to locations of increased sensitivity \cite{stevens1981constraints, goldstone2010categorical, halle1979some}

\subsection{Learned Categorical Perception}

However, we also know that the boundary location is experience dependent. Native language exposure can shift boundary locations. Also, a sound difference that crosses a boundary of a language is more discriminable to speakers of that language than to speakers of a language that doesnâ€™t have a boundary in that location.

Lots more here about learning on \CP, also context dependency

\subsection{Our Contribution}
We use machine learning techniques to approximate unsupervised statistical learning of the distribution of the set of natural motifs while compressing it into a lower dimensional representation. This allows us to generate a continuum of synthetic motifs that lie between exemplars.

These types of machine learning methods allow for the creation of synthetic continua between exemplars when trained upon a corpus of that stimuli type. This allows for the exploration of natural ecologically relevant animal communication signals as we have done here. It also would allow the exploration of categorical perception in non-English languages. For example, technical difficulty in creating the Chinese-based synthetic continuum suitable for a \CP study has been proposed as a reason for the large number of papers focused on \CP in lexical tones in the Chinese language \cite{zhang2013categorical}.

Furthermore, stimulus naturalness has been shown to be a factor determining the degree of categorical perception\cite{van1999categorical}, so as these machine learning techniques improve, we may be able to better explore the \CP phenomena.

Our method allows for the creation or discovery of boundaries of \CP in an unsupervised way in animal vocalizations and are thus more ecologically relevant and activate auditory regions that are specifically tuned to conspecific vocalizations.
